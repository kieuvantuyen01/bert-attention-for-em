                            Seagate 1TB-per-disk technology marks another major milestone for the hard drive industry. To make this happen, Seagate engineers had to pack 340,000 hard drive tracks into the width of a single inch. This means that, when reading and writing data, the read/write head needs to accurately follow a track that is a mere 75 nano meters wide. That's about 500 times smaller than the period at the end of this sentence. Seagate AcuTrac technology helps enable this incredible feat-reliably and accurately following these nano tracks even in challenging operating environments, like an all-in-one PC with the music turned up. Barracuda 1TB-per-disk hard drives now include a host of refined technologies to further boost performance.

                        At first glance, the all new Olympus TG-Tracker looks rugged and compact, easy to carry and easy to shoot. But there's far more here than meets the eye. That's because TG-Tracker is part of the Olympus Tough Family - worry-free cameras built to handle abuse so you can concentrate on getting great shots. TG-Tracker is waterproof to depths of 100 ft (30m), crushproof up to 220 lbf (100kgf), shockproof from 7ft (2.1m), freezeproof to 14F (-10C), and dustproof. Most other action cams need protective housings. That means more stuff to carry around, clumsy camera operation, and a difficult time capturing sound. With TG-Tracker, no housing equals better overall performance.
For adventurers looking to analyze their activities, switch the TG-Tracker to LOG mode to record the data from the camera's built-in GPS, compass, accelerometer, thermometer, and barometer. The location data from these sensors, such as location, altitude, direction, and temperature, can be viewed on the camera's monitor and downloaded for later use with the Olympus Image Track (OI.Track) mobile app.

The Electribe sampler is a sample-based production machine that lets you construct beats at maximum speed. You can freely edit and resample using waveforms that you've loaded and preset samples. Modulation and effects can be controlled easily just by turning knobs on the top panel. In addition, a variety of input interfaces optimized for inputting rhythm, bass, or melody allow you to smoothly create sequences as fast as you can think. The sequences that you create can then undergo additional evolution on stage or in your laptop. You can enjoy intuitive live performances that link various devices with the Electribe sampler, or utilize this capability for full-fledged music production by exporting sequence data to Ableton Live for detailed editing and final mixing. 

The latest system version 2 adds a much-requested pattern chain function that will be a great asset for live performances or music production. The lineup has also become more colorful with the new metallic red model. And we've also provided bonus patterns that reveal even greater sonic potential. Making your beat-making ideas rapidly take shape. It's the Electribe sampler; a sampler + sequencer that's thoroughly optimized for speed.

Features:

    Effortless knob-based sample shaping
    Import any waveform and resample
    High-quality preset samples that let your ideas take shape quickly

Perfect for professional studios, this 18 x 20 Thunderbolt interface offers twice the analog connectivity of the Apollo 8/8p, making it ideal for pairing with mixing consoles and outboard processors. Apollo 16 further distinguishes itself with Realtime UAD Processing, letting you record at near-zero latency through the full range of UAD plug-ins from Neve, Studer, Manley, Lexicon, and more.* Apollo Expanded software now allows cascading up to four Apollos and six total UAD-2 devices in a single system over Thunderbolt (Mac), so you can scale up your studio as your needs grow. With its powerful onboard UAD-2 QUAD processing, genuine UA analog design, and next-generation A/D and D/A conversion, Apollo 16 puts class-leading audio performance in a sleek new package.Key Features● Next-generation Apollo A/D and D/A conversion for professional music production● Onboard UAD-2 QUAD Core DSP allows Realtime UAD Processing — record through plug-ins from Neve, Lexicon, Studer, Manley, Ampex, and more*● 18 x 20 Thunderbolt 2 audio interface for Mac with powerful Console 2.0 software control● 16 x 16 analog I/O via DB-25 connectors — ideal for pairing with mixing consoles, outboard preamps, etc.● Cascade up to 4 Apollo interfaces and 6 UAD devices total over Thunderbolt● Includes “Realtime Analog Classics Plus” UAD plug-in bundle with 610-B Tube Preamp & EQ, Raw Distortion, Softube Amp Rooms, legacy LA-2A, 1176, and Fairchild compressors, Pultec EQs, and more● World class UA analog design, superior components, and premium build qualityNext-Generation Apollo A/D and D/A ConversionApollo 16 improves upon the original Apollo’s gold-standard audio quality with completely redesigned, class-leading digital conversion — giving you increased dynamic range and even lower THD. This results in breathtaking clarity, depth, and accuracy in your recordings, from tracking and overdubbing, to mixing and mastering.Realtime UAD Plug-In Processing for Tracking, Mixing, and MasteringWhile Apollo 16’s “natural” sound is very open and transparent, it can quickly deliver a stunning range of classic analog tones and color via its Realtime UAD Processing. Available with generous UAD-2 QUAD processing onboard, Apollo’s DSP Acceleration allows for recording through UAD Powered Plug-Ins — with as low as sub-2ms latency — letting you monitor and “print” audio using classic analog emulations from Ampex, Lexicon, Manley, Neve, Roland, SSL, Studer, and more.* The Apollo 16’s bundled “Realtime Analog Classics Plus” suite of UAD plug-ins gives you the UA 610-B Tube Preamp & EQ, Raw Distortion, Softube Amp Rooms, legacy LA-2A, 1176, and Fairchild compressors, Pultec EQs, and more, so you have a rack full of bonafide audio classics, right out of the box.Using Apollo, UAD plug-ins are also available during mixing and mastering, putting UAD plug-ins (VST, RTAS, AU, AAX 64) at your disposal throughout the creative process. Apollo Expanded and Console 2.0Thanks to Apollo Expanded software, users of Thunderbolt-equipped Apollo Twin, Apollo 8, Apollo 8p, and Apollo 16 audio interfaces can combine up to four Apollos and six total UAD-2 devices — adding I/O and DSP as their studio grows. Apollo Expanded also provides seamless integration with previous generation Apollos over Thunderbolt. With Apollo 16’s Console 2.0 application — a complete re-imagining of Apollo’s original Console software — you can take advantage of over 25 user-requested features such as Channel Strip presets, Drag & Drop functionality, dynamically resizable windows, and more.*All trademarks are recognized as property of their respective owners.

                            Seagate 1TB-per-disk technology marks another major milestone for the hard drive industry. To make this happen, Seagate engineers had to pack 340,000 hard drive tracks into the width of a single inch. This means that, when reading and writing data, the read/write head needs to accurately follow a track that is a mere 75 nano meters wide. That's about 500 times smaller than the period at the end of this sentence. Seagate AcuTrac technology helps enable this incredible feat-reliably and accurately following these nano tracks even in challenging operating environments, like an all-in-one PC with the music turned up. Barracuda 1TB-per-disk hard drives now include a host of refined technologies to further boost performance. Combined, these improvements squeeze even more performance out of storage already known for pushing the envelope.Best-Fit Applications: Desktop or all-in-one PCs; Home servers; PC-based gaming systems; Desktop RAID; Direct-attached external storage devices (DAS); Network-attached storage devices (NAS).

                            Seagate 1TB-per-disk technology marks another major milestone for the hard drive industry. To make this happen, Seagate engineers had to pack 340,000 hard drive tracks into the width of a single inch. This means that, when reading and writing data, the read/write head needs to accurately follow a track that is a mere 75 nano meters wide. That's about 500 times smaller than the period at the end of this sentence. Seagate AcuTrac technology helps enable this incredible feat-reliably and accurately following these nano tracks even in challenging operating environments, like an all-in-one PC with the music turned up. Barracuda 1TB-per-disk hard drives now include a host of refined technologies to further boost performance. Combined, these improvements squeeze even more performance out of storage already known for pushing the envelope.Best-Fit Applications: Desktop or all-in-one PCs; Home servers; PC-based gaming systems; Desktop RAID; Direct-attached external storage devices (DAS); Network-attached storage devices (NAS).

                            Seagate 1TB-per-disk technology marks another major milestone for the hard drive industry. To make this happen, Seagate engineers had to pack 340,000 hard drive tracks into the width of a single inch. This means that, when reading and writing data, the read/write head needs to accurately follow a track that is a mere 75 nano meters wide. That's about 500 times smaller than the period at the end of this sentence. Seagate AcuTrac technology helps enable this incredible feat-reliably and accurately following these nano tracks even in challenging operating environments, like an all-in-one PC with the music turned up. Barracuda 1TB-per-disk hard drives now include a host of refined technologies to further boost performance. Combined, these improvements squeeze even more performance out of storage already known for pushing the envelope.Best-Fit Applications: Desktop or all-in-one PCs; Home servers; PC-based gaming systems; Desktop RAID; Direct-attached external storage devices (DAS); Network-attached storage devices (NAS).

The ideal choice for workstations, desktop RAID, gaming PCs, high-end PCs, mainstream PCs and USB/FireWire/eSATA external storage. After years of pioneering research at Seagate, perpendicular recording is now a proven technology. It increases capacity and dependability by storing data vertically, rather than horizontally. And vertically stored data bits mean increased data density which means higher performance to increase productivity. This drive delivers excellent power savings without sacrificing drive or system performance, giving customers the ability to manufacture PC systems and external storage systems that meet energy savings requirements. Seagate hard drives have long been produced with the environment in mind, and not just with low power consumption. With Seagate and the Barracuda drive, our customers can have the best of both worlds, top hard-drive performance and the satisfaction of knowing they are using a high-capacity drive with a very small eco-footprint.""@en-US ","""Seagate""@en-US",,1

                            Intel Virtualization Technology allows one hardware platform to function as multiple “virtual” platforms. It offers improved manageability by limiting downtime and maintaining productivity by isolating computing activities into separate partitions.

Intel 64 architecture delivers 64-bit computing on server, workstation, desktop and mobile platforms when combined with supporting software. Intel 64 architecture improves performance by allowing systems to address more than 4 GB of both virtual and physical memory.

Idle States are used to save power when the processor is idle. C0 is the operational state, meaning that the CPU is doing useful work. C1 is the first idle state, C2 the second, and so on, where more power saving actions are taken for numerically higher C-states.

Enhanced Intel SpeedStep Technology is an advanced means of enabling high performance while meeting the power-conservation needs of mobile systems. Conventional Intel SpeedStep Technology switches both voltage and frequency in tandem between high and low levels in response to processor load. Enhanced Intel SpeedStep Technology builds upon that architecture using design strategies such as Separation between Voltage and Frequency Changes, and Clock Partitioning and Recovery.

Thermal Monitoring Technologies protect the processor package and the system from thermal failure through several thermal management features. An on-die Digital Thermal Sensor detects the core's temperature, and the thermal management features reduce package power consumption and thereby temperature when required in order to remain within normal operating limits.

Execute Disable Bit is a hardware-based security feature that can reduce exposure to viruses and malicious-code attacks and prevent harmful software from executing and propagating on the server or network.

With a mesh-free front panel and clean, understated lines, the 100R Silent Edition is both professional enough for the office and customizable enough for any home PC build.Keep it quietThe side panels are insulated with noise-isolating materials to reduce noticeable fan noise. This essential if you’re building a media PC, and just plain nice if don’t want your system to contribute to environmental noise.3-Speed fan controllerThe secret to silent PC design is putting you in control. Keep the three-speed fan controller at its lowest setting for silent operation. When it’s time to push your system hard, take it up a notch or two for on-demand cooling.Storage, simplified.The simplicity begins with tool-free 3.5” and 5.25” drive installation, and all four hard drive trays provide solid-state drive support so you can mix and match to fit your needs. On the outside, dual USB 3.0 front panel ports give you quick and easy access to the latest high-speed portable hard drives and flash drives.Creative coolingTwo 120mm fans are included, and five internal fan mounts let you customize your cooling to match your build.

This case-less SSD features sequential read speeds of up to 540 MB/s and sequential write speeds of up to 500 MB/s allowing for the rapid transfer of large files. By utilizing SATA III technologies, this drive is able to deliver data performance to your system as well as ensuring compatibility as a boot drive. This Samsung SSD even comes with 512MB of low power DDR3 SDRAM used as cache memory to enhance processing speeds.With a M.2 form factor, this solid state drive is designed to be used in a variety of notebook, ultrabook, and desktop computers. The SSD's reduced size is achieved through the use of Samsung's 3D V-NAND flash memory as each of the 32 cell layers are stacked vertically rather than horizontally. Samsung also implements their own TurboWrite technology to deliver enhanced sequential read and write speeds while Rapid Mode software utilizes the integrated cache (DRAM) memory to improve processing speeds. Insert this drive into a notebook with an M.2 slot, and it will benefit from improved battery life with the MGX controller allowing the drive to sleep at an efficient 2 mW.

                            Seagate 1TB-per-disk technology marks another major milestone for the hard drive industry. To make this happen, Seagate engineers had to pack 340,000 hard drive tracks into the width of a single inch. This means that, when reading and writing data, the read/write head needs to accurately follow a track that is a mere 75 nano meters wide. That's about 500 times smaller than the period at the end of this sentence. Seagate AcuTrac technology helps enable this incredible feat-reliably and accurately following these nano tracks even in challenging operating environments, like an all-in-one PC with the music turned up. Barracuda 1TB-per-disk hard drives now include a host of refined technologies to further boost performance. Combined, these improvements squeeze even more performance out of storage already known for pushing the envelope.Best-Fit Applications: Desktop or all-in-one PCs; Home servers; PC-based gaming systems; Desktop RAID; Direct-attached external storage devices (DAS); Network-attached storage devices (NAS).

                            Seagate 1TB-per-disk technology marks another major milestone for the hard drive industry. To make this happen, Seagate engineers had to pack 340,000 hard drive tracks into the width of a single inch. This means that, when reading and writing data, the read/write head needs to accurately follow a track that is a mere 75 nano meters wide. That's about 500 times smaller than the period at the end of this sentence. Seagate AcuTrac technology helps enable this incredible feat-reliably and accurately following these nano tracks even in challenging operating environments, like an all-in-one PC with the music turned up. Barracuda 1TB-per-disk hard drives now include a host of refined technologies to further boost performance. Combined, these improvements squeeze even more performance out of storage already known for pushing the envelope.Best-Fit Applications: Desktop or all-in-one PCs; Home servers; PC-based gaming systems; Desktop RAID; Direct-attached external storage devices (DAS); Network-attached storage devices (NAS).

The SSD's reduced size is achieved through the use of Samsung's 3D V-NAND flash memory as each of the 32 cell layers are stacked vertically rather than horizontally. Samsung also implements their own TurboWrite technology to deliver enhanced sequential read and write speeds while Rapid Mode software utilizes the integrated cache (DRAM) memory to improve processing speeds. Insert this drive into a notebook with an M.2 slot, and it will benefit from improved battery life with the MGX controller allowing the drive to sleep at an efficient 2 mW.
