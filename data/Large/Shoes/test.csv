Stefan Janoski can't have known the impact on skateboarding his first pro shoe with Nike SB would have. He stuck to his guns during the design process, coupling a boat shoe aesthetic with all of the technology to hand. What resulted was one of the most insanely popular skate shoes of all time, the main reason for this being just how well it works. They are good to go out of the box, last well and have an unsurpassed board feel.

                                    The new Nike Free RUN draws upon new studies that reveal how the foot expands and contracts upon impact with the ground. For this reason, Nike designers have developed an auxetic midsole that allows it to splay upon impact without it thinning out (think about stretching an elastic band, which thins out when it’s pulled apart and is then compromised at its weakest point).

Nike Free Origins
After learning that Stanford athletes had been training barefoot on the university's golf course, three of Nike's most innovative and creative employees set out to develop a shoe that felt natural and weightless, similar to bare feet. The team spent eight years studying the biomechanics of runners' feet in motion. The results yielded a profound understanding of the foot's natural landing angle, pressure and toe position, allowing Nike designers to build an unconventional and flexible running shoe from the inside out.

                                    The new Nike Free RUN draws upon new studies that reveal how the foot expands and contracts upon impact with the ground. For this reason, Nike designers have developed an auxetic midsole that allows it to splay upon impact without it thinning out (think about stretching an elastic band, which thins out when it’s pulled apart and is then compromised at its weakest point). Spreading across two planes, the geometric tri-star form mimics how the body and foot react to force and accounts for the massive changes in foot size (approximately one size in length and two sizes in width) that occur throughout a runner’s stride to deliver support and flexibility.Revolutionary, never before used Soft Foam provides comfort and cushioning without compromising natural motion.Offering breathability with an engineered mesh upper, the new Free RUN incorporates Flywire technology integrated with the laces for an adaptive, supportive fit.Features Include:Engineered mesh upper supports as it moves with you.Low-profile cushioning and rounded heel encourage natural footstrike.Auxetic tri-star outsole pattern expands with your step for flexible cushioning.Flywire technology integrated with the laces for an adaptive supportive fit.Offset: 8mm Last: QD-39

Worn by Gerard Piqué, Jérôme Boateng and Andrea Pirlo, the 6th iteration Tiempo Legend furthers its reputation for providing unrivalled fit, touch and traction to establish a new era for this modern classic.FIT:To provide a fit worthy of the Tiempo Legend title, the cleats feature a new integrated tongue construction, which will ensure the tongue won’t slide providing a consistent fit. For support and increased lock down, the Tiempo Legend 6 includes an internal microfiber cage in the midfoot to bring the upper closer to the foot, providing a 1-to-1 fit that will help enhance that dominating touch on the ball.Working in tandem with the midfoot cage, the molded heel counter will conform to the natural shape of the foot to prevent any heel slippage, while a microfiber cloth on top of the insole also works to eliminate any foot movement within the boot.TOUCH:For instant control on the ball, the Tiempo Legend 6 features adaptive K-leather on the vamp of the cleats. This leather is vacuum pressed to the interior cage to provide a quilted effect, for superior touch when passing and receiving the ball.With the leather vacuum pressed, this reduces the amount of water uptake to keep the upper remaining soft and light, while ACC (All Conditions Control) technology provides optimal ball control in both wet and dry conditions.TRACTION:A full length engineered TPU plate and insole board work together to provide these Nike soccer cleats with a smooth transition from midfoot to forefoot and multi-directional flexibility.The SG-Pro stud configuration features fixed studs and two sets of screw-in aluminium studs (11/13mm and 13/15mm) for versatile traction, comfort and underfoot control on soft ground.

If you want a futuristic runner made out of mesh upper, it is a good idea to have a closer look at the Nike Roshe One.
It is more a lifestyle and lightweight sneaker that adds lot of comfort without the air cushioning. On the upper you can find tonal stitching in wolf grey, nice and comfortable fabric lining in wolf grey and a foamed sockliner which you can also remove if you want.
On the tongue you can find also a woven Nike Swoosh loop in white without any stitching on the back. If you need a fresh running silhouette with quarter support, heel support and some cushioning you have to try out the Nike Roshe One. At the white midsole you will find a special EVA compound, that is soft but supportive and has the durability of a soft rubber.

As this underground music scene rose to the street surface, the Puma Suede started making moves among break dance crews and hip-hop club-goers.This revolution, like others, disrupted the norm. It followed the logic of the decade. And so did PUMA. Puma felt the culture shift beneath their feet from strict convention into self-expression. They responded by translating sports gear into street wear.The Puma Suede tells the story of sport-inspired style. This time-honoured member of the PUMA Archive continues to evolve with the times while maintaining its smooth silhouette, swagger and grit. The Puma Suede proves that no matter the decade, the city, the continent -style can be revolutionary.Early break dance crews whole-heartedly adopted the Puma Suede for its sweet tread and smooth, classic look. Basketball legend Walt 'Clyde' Frazier inspired PUMA's infamous 'Clyde' silhouette and made some of his best moves in the Puma Suede.'B-Boy' is short for 'break-boy ' as in 'a break dancing boy'. A growing number of 'B-Girls' are currently on the rise. In a past life, the Puma Suede was a sport hero: In 1968, it was worn by track and field champion Tommie Smith at the Summer Games.'Airtracks' are said to be the toughest and most dangerous break dance moves in existence - cue the Puma Suede treads for traction and take-off.Features Include:100% Suede upper for optimum comfortCentrally-positioned lacing with broad laces for a perfect fitNon-slip and abrasion-resistant outer sole made from 100% RubberPUMA formstrip PUMA Suede archive logo and PUMA Cat logo

                                    A newly designed tri-star outsole pattern adjusts to your foot's every step, delivering support and flexibility.The new Nike Free Run Flyknit draws upon new studies that reveal how the foot expands and contracts upon impact with the ground. For this reason, Nike designers have developed an auxetic midsole that allows it to splay upon impact without it thinning out (think about stretching an elastic band, which thins out when it’s pulled apart and is then compromised at its weakest point). Spreading across two planes, the geometric tri-star form mimics how the body and foot react to force and accounts for the massive changes in foot size (approximately one size in length and two sizes in width) that occur throughout a runner’s stride to deliver support and flexibility.Revolutionary, never before used Soft Foam provides comfort and cushioning without compromising natural motion.Flywire technology is integrated with the laces and Flyknit upper for a dynamic midfoot fit, along with asymmetrical lacing that follows the natural lines of the foot to help reduce lace pressure.Please be advised that the Nike Free shoe collection seems to be coming up slightly large by half a size and as a result we recommend considering half a size smaller.Features Include:Strong lightweight Flyknit upper construction provides a sock-like fit.Low-profile cushioning and rounded heel encourage natural footstrike.Auxetic tri-star outsole pattern expands with your step for flexible cushioning.Flywire cables integrate with the laces for a dynamic midfoot fit.Notch in the collar allows for easy on and off.Asymmetrical lacing follows the natural lines of the foot to help reduce lace pressure.

                                    START THE FINISHStart every attack on the pitch in the new Nike Tiempo 6 soccer cleats. Worn by Gerard Piqué, Jérôme Boateng and Andrea Pirlo, the 6th iteration Tiempo Legend furthers its reputation for providing unrivalled fit, touch and traction to establish a new era for this modern classic.FIT:To provide a fit worthy of the Tiempo Legend title, the cleats feature a new integrated tongue construction, which will ensure the tongue won’t slide providing a consistent fit. For support and increased lock down, the Tiempo Legend 6 includes an internal microfiber cage in the midfoot to bring the upper closer to the foot, providing a 1-to-1 fit that will help enhance that dominating touch on the ball.Working in tandem with the midfoot cage, the molded heel counter will conform to the natural shape of the foot to prevent any heel slippage, while a microfiber cloth on top of the insole also works to eliminate any foot movement within the boot.TOUCH:For instant control on the ball, the Tiempo Legend 6 features adaptive K-leather on the vamp of the cleats. This leather is vacuum pressed to the interior cage to provide a quilted effect, for superior touch when passing and receiving the ball.With the leather vacuum pressed, this reduces the amount of water uptake to keep the upper remaining soft and light, while ACC (All Conditions Control) technology provides optimal ball control in both wet and dry conditions.TRACTION:A full length engineered TPU plate and insole board work together to provide these Nike soccer cleats with a smooth transition from midfoot to forefoot and multi-directional flexibility.The SG-Pro stud configuration features fixed studs and two sets of screw-in aluminium studs (11/13mm and 13/15mm) for versatile traction, comfort and underfoot control on soft ground.

                                    A newly designed tri-star outsole pattern adjusts to your foot's every step, delivering support and flexibility.The new Nike Free Run Flyknit draws upon new studies that reveal how the foot expands and contracts upon impact with the ground. For this reason, Nike designers have developed an auxetic midsole that allows it to splay upon impact without it thinning out (think about stretching an elastic band, which thins out when it’s pulled apart and is then compromised at its weakest point). Spreading across two planes, the geometric tri-star form mimics how the body and foot react to force and accounts for the massive changes in foot size (approximately one size in length and two sizes in width) that occur throughout a runner’s stride to deliver support and flexibility.Revolutionary, never before used Soft Foam provides comfort and cushioning without compromising natural motion.Flywire technology is integrated with the laces and Flyknit upper for a dynamic midfoot fit, along with asymmetrical lacing that follows the natural lines of the foot to help reduce lace pressure.Please be advised that the Nike Free shoe collection seems to be coming up slightly large by half a size and as a result we recommend considering half a size smaller.Features Include:Strong lightweight Flyknit upper construction provides a sock-like fit.Low-profile cushioning and rounded heel encourage natural footstrike.Auxetic tri-star outsole pattern expands with your step for flexible cushioning.Flywire cables integrate with the laces for a dynamic midfoot fit.Notch in the collar allows for easy on and off.Asymmetrical lacing follows the natural lines of the foot to help reduce lace pressure.

                                    PUMA’s speed boot has evolved to take lightweight to a whole new level, with the brand presenting its lightest match day boot ever. The new PUMA evoSPEED SL features an ultra-thin textile upper to provide an almost barefoot touch on the ball, while also reducing the overall weight of the boot to produce an extremely lightweight feel on your feet.Within the upper of the evoSPEED SL is the brand’s laser-cut SPEEDFRAME system, which in key areas harnesses the foot when accelerating and turning under heavy pressure. The sole of this SL features PUMA’s raised SPEEDTRACK spines to offer torsional stability to the foot for explosive power when striking the ball.Designed for use on firm ground surfaces only. The soleplate of this boot features a mixture of conical and bladed studs to supply instant traction for better acceleration, creating devastating moments of speed on the pitch for when it matters most.Features Include:Please note the evoSPEED SL is not for training days. It's for your best days. Your match days. It may only be used on real grass and in fair weather conditions. A non-compromise lightweight proposition this product is about speed not endurance. But the moments it creates will last forever.

                                    Puma Suede Classic Eco - Black/WhiteThe Puma Suede was ignited in the late 60s and still invigorates today. Worn by athletic greats such as basketball's Walt 'Clyde' Frazier and the track 's Tommie Smith, it rose to new levels of fame in the early days of b-boys and funk beats. As this underground music scene rose to the street surface, the Puma Suede started making moves among break dance crews and hip-hop club-goers.This revolution, like others, disrupted the norm. It followed the logic of the decade. And so did PUMA. Puma felt the culture shift beneath their feet from strict convention into self-expression. They responded by translating sports gear into street wear.The Puma Suede tells the story of sport-inspired style. This time-honoured member of the PUMA Archive continues to evolve with the times while maintaining its smooth silhouette, swagger and grit. The Puma Suede proves that no matter the decade, the city, the continent -style can be revolutionary. Early break dance crews whole-heartedly adopted the Puma Suede for its sweet tread and smooth, classic look. Basketball legend Walt 'Clyde' Frazier inspired PUMA's infamous 'Clyde' silhouette and made some of his best moves in the Puma Suede.'B-Boy' is short for  'break-boy ' as in 'a break dancing boy'. A growing number of 'B-Girls' are currently on the rise. In a past life, the Puma Suede was a sport hero: In 1968, it was worn by track and field champion Tommie Smith at the Summer Games.'Airtracks' are said to be the toughest and most dangerous break dance moves in existence - cue the Puma Suede treads for traction and take-off.

If you want a futuristic runner made out of mesh upper, it is a good idea to have a closer look at the Nike Roshe One.
It is more a lifestyle and lightweight sneaker that adds lot of comfort without the air cushioning. On the upper you can find tonal stitching in black, nice and comfortable mesh lining in black and a foamed sockliner which you can also remove if you want.
On the tongue you can find also a woven Nike Swoosh loop in black without any stitching on the back. If you need a fresh running silhouette with quarter support, heel support and some cushioning you have to try out the Nike Roshe One. At the complete black midsole you will find a special EVA compound, that is soft but supportive and has the durability of a soft rubber.

                                    The new Nike Free RUN draws upon new studies that reveal how the foot expands and contracts upon impact with the ground.

Spreading across two planes, the geometric tri-star form mimics how the body and foot react to force and accounts for the massive changes in foot size (approximately one size in length and two sizes in width) that occur throughout a runner’s stride to deliver support and flexibility.Revolutionary, never before used Soft Foam provides comfort and cushioning without compromising natural motion.Offering breathability with an engineered mesh upper, the new Free RUN incorporates Flywire technology integrated with the laces for an adaptive, supportive fit.Features Include:Engineered mesh upper supports as it moves with you.Low-profile cushioning and rounded heel encourage natural footstrike.Auxetic tri-star outsole pattern expands with your step for flexible cushioning.Flywire technology integrated with the laces for an adaptive supportive fit.Offset: 8mm Last: QD-39

                                    Puma Suede Classic Eco - Team Regal Red/WhiteThe Puma Suede was ignited in the late 60s and still invigorates today. Worn by athletic greats such as basketball's Walt 'Clyde' Frazier and the track 's Tommie Smith, it rose to new levels of fame in the early days of b-boys and funk beats. As this underground music scene rose to the street surface, the Puma Suede started making moves among break dance crews and hip-hop club-goers.This revolution, like others, disrupted the norm. It followed the logic of the decade. And so did PUMA. Puma felt the culture shift beneath their feet from strict convention into self-expression. They responded by translating sports gear into street wear.The Puma Suede tells the story of sport-inspired style. This time-honoured member of the PUMA Archive continues to evolve with the times while maintaining its smooth silhouette, swagger and grit. The Puma Suede proves that no matter the decade, the city, the continent -style can be revolutionary. Early break dance crews whole-heartedly adopted the Puma Suede for its sweet tread and smooth, classic look. Basketball legend Walt 'Clyde' Frazier inspired PUMA's infamous 'Clyde' silhouette and made some of his best moves in the Puma Suede.'B-Boy' is short for  'break-boy ' as in 'a break dancing boy'. A growing number of 'B-Girls' are currently on the rise.

                                    The new Nike Free RUN draws upon new studies that reveal how the foot expands and contracts upon impact with the ground. For this reason, Nike designers have developed an auxetic midsole that allows it to splay upon impact without it thinning out (think about stretching an elastic band, which thins out when it’s pulled apart and is then compromised at its weakest point). Spreading across two planes, the geometric tri-star form mimics how the body and foot react to force and accounts for the massive changes in foot size (approximately one size in length and two sizes in width) that occur throughout a runner’s stride to deliver support and flexibility.Revolutionary, never before used Soft Foam provides comfort and cushioning without compromising natural motion.Offering breathability with an engineered mesh upper, the new Free RUN incorporates Flywire technology integrated with the laces for an adaptive, supportive fit.Features Include:Engineered mesh upper supports as it moves with you.Low-profile cushioning and rounded heel encourage natural footstrike.Auxetic tri-star outsole pattern expands with your step for flexible cushioning.Flywire technology integrated with the laces for an adaptive supportive fit.Offset: 8mm Last: QD-39

                                    The new Nike Free RUN draws upon new studies that reveal how the foot expands and contracts upon impact with the ground. For this reason, Nike designers have developed an auxetic midsole that allows it to splay upon impact without it thinning out (think about stretching an elastic band, which thins out when it’s pulled apart and is then compromised at its weakest point).

The arch has been modified with transtarsal diagonal flex cuts for enhanced twisting, strengthening, and natural motion flexibilityIn the Nike Free continuum, the lower the number in a shoe’s name, the closer it comes to barefoot running (on the continuum, 10.0 represents conventional footwear while zero represents the bare foot). The Nike Free 3.0 shoe is the closest Nike has come to delivering a truly barefoot experience for optimal foot strengthening and flexibility.Ball-to-Heel offset = 4mm differential heel to forefoot drop: The lower the number, the closer to to ground you are and the more it stretches your Achilles tendon.

Nike Free Origins 
After learning that Stanford athletes had been training barefoot on the university's golf course, three of Nike's most innovative and creative employees set out to develop a shoe that felt natural and weightless, similar to bare feet. The team spent eight years studying the biomechanics of runners' feet in motion. The results yielded a profound understanding of the foot's natural landing angle, pressure and toe position, allowing Nike designers to build an unconventional and flexible running shoe from the inside out.

As this underground music scene rose to the street surface, the Puma Suede started making moves among break dance crews and hip-hop club-goers.This revolution, like others, disrupted the norm. It followed the logic of the decade. And so did PUMA. Puma felt the culture shift beneath their feet from strict convention into self-expression. They responded by translating sports gear into street wear.The Puma Suede tells the story of sport-inspired style. This time-honoured member of the PUMA Archive continues to evolve with the times while maintaining its smooth silhouette, swagger and grit. The Puma Suede proves that no matter the decade, the city, the continent -style can be revolutionary.Early break dance crews whole-heartedly adopted the Puma Suede for its sweet tread and smooth, classic look. Basketball legend Walt 'Clyde' Frazier inspired PUMA's infamous 'Clyde' silhouette and made some of his best moves in the Puma Suede.'B-Boy' is short for 'break-boy ' as in 'a break dancing boy'. A growing number of 'B-Girls' are currently on the rise. In a past life, the Puma Suede was a sport hero: In 1968, it was worn by track and field champion Tommie Smith at the Summer Games.'Airtracks' are said to be the toughest and most dangerous break dance moves in existence - cue the Puma Suede treads for traction and take-off.Features Include:100% Suede upper for optimum comfortCentrally-positioned lacing with broad laces for a perfect fitNon-slip and abrasion-resistant outer sole made from 100% RubberPUMA formstrip PUMA Suede archive logo and PUMA Cat logo

On the tongue you can find also a woven Nike Swoosh loop in black without any stitching on the back.

                                    Puma Suede Classic Eco - Team Regal Red/WhiteThe Puma Suede was ignited in the late 60s and still invigorates today. Worn by athletic greats such as basketball's Walt 'Clyde' Frazier and the track 's Tommie Smith, it rose to new levels of fame in the early days of b-boys and funk beats. As this underground music scene rose to the street surface, the Puma Suede started making moves among break dance crews and hip-hop club-goers.This revolution, like others, disrupted the norm. It followed the logic of the decade. And so did PUMA. Puma felt the culture shift beneath their feet from strict convention into self-expression. They responded by translating sports gear into street wear.The Puma Suede tells the story of sport-inspired style. This time-honoured member of the PUMA Archive continues to evolve with the times while maintaining its smooth silhouette, swagger and grit. The Puma Suede proves that no matter the decade, the city, the continent -style can be revolutionary. Early break dance crews whole-heartedly adopted the Puma Suede for its sweet tread and smooth, classic look. Basketball legend Walt 'Clyde' Frazier inspired PUMA's infamous 'Clyde' silhouette and made some of his best moves in the Puma Suede.'B-Boy' is short for  'break-boy ' as in 'a break dancing boy'. A growing number of 'B-Girls' are currently on the rise. In a past life, the Puma Suede was a sport hero: In 1968, it was worn by track and field champion Tommie Smith at the Summer Games.'Airtracks' are said to be the toughest and most dangerous break dance moves in existence - cue the Puma Suede treads for traction and take-off.

                                    Puma Suede Classic Eco - Team Regal Red/WhiteThe Puma Suede was ignited in the late 60s and still invigorates today. Worn by athletic greats such as basketball's Walt 'Clyde' Frazier and the track 's Tommie Smith, it rose to new levels of fame in the early days of b-boys and funk beats. As this underground music scene rose to the street surface, the Puma Suede started making moves among break dance crews and hip-hop club-goers.This revolution, like others, disrupted the norm. It followed the logic of the decade. And so did PUMA. Puma felt the culture shift beneath their feet from strict convention into self-expression. They responded by translating sports gear into street wear.The Puma Suede tells the story of sport-inspired style. This time-honoured member of the PUMA Archive continues to evolve with the times while maintaining its smooth silhouette, swagger and grit. The Puma Suede proves that no matter the decade, the city, the continent -style can be revolutionary. Early break dance crews whole-heartedly adopted the Puma Suede for its sweet tread and smooth, classic look. Basketball legend Walt 'Clyde' Frazier inspired PUMA's infamous 'Clyde' silhouette and made some of his best moves in the Puma Suede.'B-Boy' is short for  'break-boy ' as in 'a break dancing boy'. A growing number of 'B-Girls' are currently on the rise. In a past life, the Puma Suede was a sport hero: In 1968, it was worn by track and field champion Tommie Smith at the Summer Games.'Airtracks' are said to be the toughest and most dangerous break dance moves in existence - cue the Puma Suede treads for traction and take-off.

                                    START THE FINISHStart every attack on the pitch in the new Nike Tiempo 6 soccer cleats. Worn by Gerard Piqué, Jérôme Boateng and Andrea Pirlo, the 6th iteration Tiempo Legend furthers its reputation for providing unrivalled fit, touch and traction to establish a new era for this modern classic.FIT:To provide a fit worthy of the Tiempo Legend title, the cleats feature a new integrated tongue construction, which will ensure the tongue won’t slide providing a consistent fit. For support and increased lock down, the Tiempo Legend 6 includes an internal microfiber cage in the midfoot to bring the upper closer to the foot, providing a 1-to-1 fit that will help enhance that dominating touch on the ball.Working in tandem with the midfoot cage, the molded heel counter will conform to the natural shape of the foot to prevent any heel slippage, while a microfiber cloth on top of the insole also works to eliminate any foot movement within the boot.TOUCH:For instant control on the ball, the Tiempo Legend 6 features adaptive K-leather on the vamp of the cleats. This leather is vacuum pressed to the interior cage to provide a quilted effect, for superior touch when passing and receiving the ball.With the leather vacuum pressed, this reduces the amount of water uptake to keep the upper remaining soft and light, while ACC (All Conditions Control) technology provides optimal ball control in both wet and dry conditions.TRACTION:A full length engineered TPU plate and insole board work together to provide these Nike soccer cleats with a smooth transition from midfoot to forefoot and multi-directional flexibility.The SG-Pro stud configuration features fixed studs and two sets of screw-in aluminium studs (11/13mm and 13/15mm) for versatile traction, comfort and underfoot control on soft ground.

Nike Free Origins
After learning that Stanford athletes had been training barefoot on the university's golf course, three of Nike's most innovative and creative employees set out to develop a shoe that felt natural and weightless, similar to bare feet. The team spent eight years studying the biomechanics of runners' feet in motion. The results yielded a profound understanding of the foot's natural landing angle, pressure and toe position, allowing Nike designers to build an unconventional and flexible running shoe from the inside out.

The birth of a legendary trainer with visible Air unit and tight silhouette was in the year 1990. It's still one of the most sold running shoes worldwide.

A well known shape combined with Black leather around the mudguard, Black leather at the side panels, Black mesh toebox and heel area.
Quality Max Orange mesh at the inner lining and a Cool Grey swoosh, a Max Orange mesh tongue and Cool Grey accents you can find on the tongue label, White around the air unit together with a complete White midsole plus a Cool Grey outsole.

If you want a futuristic runner made out of mesh upper, it is a good idea to have a closer look at the Nike Roshe Two.
It is more a lifestyle and lightweight sneaker that adds lot of comfort without the air cushioning. On the upper you can find tonal overlays in black, nice and comfortable fabric lining in black and a foamed sockliner which you can also remove if you want.
On the tongue you can find also a woven Nike Swoosh loop in black without any stitching on the back. If you need a fresh running silhouette with quarter support, heel support and some cushioning you have to try out the Nike Roshe Two Black. At the black midsole you will find a special EVA compound, that is soft but supportive and has the durability of a soft rubber.

                                    The new Nike Free RUN draws upon new studies that reveal how the foot expands and contracts upon impact with the ground. For this reason, Nike designers have developed an auxetic midsole that allows it to splay upon impact without it thinning out (think about stretching an elastic band, which thins out when it’s pulled apart and is then compromised at its weakest point). Spreading across two planes, the geometric tri-star form mimics how the body and foot react to force and accounts for the massive changes in foot size (approximately one size in length and two sizes in width) that occur throughout a runner’s stride to deliver support and flexibility.Revolutionary, never before used Soft Foam provides comfort and cushioning without compromising natural motion.Offering breathability with an engineered mesh upper, the new Free RUN incorporates Flywire technology integrated with the laces for an adaptive, supportive fit.Features Include:Engineered mesh upper supports as it moves with you.Low-profile cushioning and rounded heel encourage natural footstrike.Auxetic tri-star outsole pattern expands with your step for flexible cushioning.Flywire technology integrated with the laces for an adaptive supportive fit.Offset: 8mm Last: QD-39

Nike Free Origins
After learning that Stanford athletes had been training barefoot on the university's golf course, three of Nike's most innovative and creative employees set out to develop a shoe that felt natural and weightless, similar to bare feet. The team spent eight years studying the biomechanics of runners' feet in motion. The results yielded a profound understanding of the foot's natural landing angle, pressure and toe position, allowing Nike designers to build an unconventional and flexible running shoe from the inside out.

                                    The third in a series of seven cleats chronicling Cristiano Ronaldo’s journey, Chapter 3 focuses on the game that brought him to the attention of one of the world’s biggest clubs. To celebrate the moment of his discovery, the Nike Mercurial Superfly features a dark green that’s inspired by his original club colours and neon accents to represent his shining talent.  FITDeveloped around the idea of a racecar fit, the Superfly V features a new V16 last, which is designed to engage the major metatarsal by shaping the outsole to the natural contours of your foot. This allows the metatarsals to sit lower in the boot while the big toe is slightly raised, increasing flex across the joint and allowing you to generate maximum power when sprinting off the mark.Constructed with a Flyknit and NikeSkin upper, the Superfly features an upgraded tongue less construction, while the Flywire cables within the upper are independently able to react to how the foot is engaging with the ground for optimal lockdown. To reduce the loss of elasticity over time, the Dynamic Fit collar has a tighter knit construction to enhance your proprioception with the ground, while its internal anti-skid top cloth eliminates any foot movement within the boot.TOUCHTo enhance your touch and feel, the Superfly V features a new 3-D textured Speed Rib construction, which is knitted into the cleat’s Flyknit upper to create increased friction on the ball for high-speed control.  Applied with Nike’s All Conditions Control (ACC) Technology, the Superfly provides consistent levels of grip on the ball in wet and dry weather conditions.TRACTIONRedesigned to improve your acceleration, the Superfly’s chassis is made from compressed Nylon, which is 40% lighter than the Carbon Fibre plate used for the Superfly IV. More responsive and shaped to the anatomical V-16 last, the soleplate features chevron shaped cleat studs for quick ground penetration, release and braking on firm natural grass surfaces.

NIKE FREE ORIGINS
After learning that Stanford athletes had been training barefoot on the university's golf course, three of Nike's most innovative and creative employees set out to develop a shoe that felt natural and weightless, similar to bare feet. The team spent eight years studying the biomechanics of runners' feet in motion. The results yielded a profound understanding of the foot's natural landing angle, pressure and toe position, allowing Nike designers to build an unconventional and flexible running shoe from the inside out.

                                    The new Nike Free RUN draws upon new studies that reveal how the foot expands and contracts upon impact with the ground. For this reason, Nike designers have developed an auxetic midsole that allows it to splay upon impact without it thinning out (think about stretching an elastic band, which thins out when it’s pulled apart and is then compromised at its weakest point). Spreading across two planes, the geometric tri-star form mimics how the body and foot react to force and accounts for the massive changes in foot size (approximately one size in length and two sizes in width) that occur throughout a runner’s stride to deliver support and flexibility.Revolutionary, never before used Soft Foam provides comfort and cushioning without compromising natural motion.Offering breathability with an engineered mesh upper, the new Free RUN incorporates Flywire technology integrated with the laces for an adaptive, supportive fit.Features Include:Engineered mesh upper supports as it moves with you.Low-profile cushioning and rounded heel encourage natural footstrike.Auxetic tri-star outsole pattern expands with your step for flexible cushioning.Flywire technology integrated with the laces for an adaptive supportive fit.Offset: 8mm Last: QD-39

If you want a futuristic runner made out of mesh upper, it is a good idea to have a closer look at the Nike WMNS Roshe Two.
It is more a lifestyle and lightweight sneaker that adds lot of comfort without the air cushioning. On the upper you can find a complete black upper together with tonal stitching in black, nice and comfortable mesh lining in black, a foamed sockliner which you can also remove if you want.
On the tongue you can find also a woven Nike Swoosh loop in black without any stitching on the back. If you need a fresh running silhouette with quarter support, heel support and some cushioning you have to try out the Nike WMNS Roshe Two Black. At the complete black midsole you will find a special EVA compound, that is soft but supportive and has the durability of a soft rubber.

                                    START THE FINISHStart every attack on the pitch in the new Nike Tiempo 6 soccer cleats. Worn by Gerard Piqué, Jérôme Boateng and Andrea Pirlo, the 6th iteration Tiempo Legend furthers its reputation for providing unrivalled fit, touch and traction to establish a new era for this modern classic.FIT:To provide a fit worthy of the Tiempo Legend title, the cleats feature a new integrated tongue construction, which will ensure the tongue won’t slide providing a consistent fit. For support and increased lock down, the Tiempo Legend 6 includes an internal microfiber cage in the midfoot to bring the upper closer to the foot, providing a 1-to-1 fit that will help enhance that dominating touch on the ball.Working in tandem with the midfoot cage, the molded heel counter will conform to the natural shape of the foot to prevent any heel slippage, while a microfiber cloth on top of the insole also works to eliminate any foot movement within the boot.TOUCH:For instant control on the ball, the Tiempo Legend 6 features adaptive K-leather on the vamp of the cleats. This leather is vacuum pressed to the interior cage to provide a quilted effect, for superior touch when passing and receiving the ball.With the leather vacuum pressed, this reduces the amount of water uptake to keep the upper remaining soft and light, while ACC (All Conditions Control) technology provides optimal ball control in both wet and dry conditions.TRACTION:A full length engineered TPU plate and insole board work together to provide these Nike soccer cleats with a smooth transition from midfoot to forefoot and multi-directional flexibility.The SG-Pro stud configuration features fixed studs and two sets of screw-in aluminium studs (11/13mm and 13/15mm) for versatile traction, comfort and underfoot control on soft ground.

If you want a futuristic runner made out of mesh and breathable synthetic weave upper, it is a good idea to have a closer look at the Nike Roshe One.
It is more a lifestyle and lightweight sneaker that adds lot of comfort without the air cushioning. On the upper you can find tonal stitching in Black, nice and comfortable fabric linning in Black and a foamed sockliner which you can also remove if you want.
On the tongue you can find also a woven Nike Swoosh loop in Black without any stitching on the back. If you need a fresh running silhouette with quarter support, heel support and some cushioning you have to try out the Nike Rosherun. At the sail midsole you will find a special EVA compound, that is soft but supportive and has the durability of a soft rubber.

                                    PLAY FAST. THINK FAST.Providing that instant connection from boot to brain, the next generation Nike Magista II takes creativity to a new level. Designed for intelligent playmakers like Mario Götze, Blaise Matudi and Kevin De Bruyne they see passes that others don’t to orchestrate attacking chances for their team.FITFor a defining fit and feel, the Magista Obra II features a new Flyknit upper, which has been engineered to provide a sock-like feel and eliminate any space around the foot for a glove-like fit. Knitted directly into the upper on the medial and lateral sides is the Magista’s Flywire cables, which run from the eyelets to the bite line for strategic lockdown, while an internal heel counter keeps the ankle stable and secure.Redesigned to link the lower leg and foot, the Dynamic Fit collar is shaped to fit the natural outline of your malleolus for a more secure and protective fit, while its tighter knit construction ensures better shape retention. TOUCH A new thermoformed Flyknit upper creates a 3-D textured upper for more friction on the ball, while ACC (All Conditions Controlled) Technology provides a consistent touch on the ball in both wet and dry conditions. The laces have been moved slightly to the medial side to create a larger surface area when striking the ball, while the tongue-less construction features added padding to ensure your touch on the ball is responsive.TRACTION   Lighter than the previous version, the Magista’s soleplate sees a reduction of Pebax for its nylon chassis, which has reduced the overall weight of the plate from 85g to 62g. This reduction allows the foot to get closer to ground, meaning a better and responsive feel when changing direction.   The stud pattern utilised for the Magista had been created using Fine Element Analysis (FEA), which is a computerised method that produces data to design a soleplate ideal for rotational traction on firm ground surfaces.

                                    The new Nike Free RUN draws upon new studies that reveal how the foot expands and contracts upon impact with the ground. For this reason, Nike designers have developed an auxetic midsole that allows it to splay upon impact without it thinning out (think about stretching an elastic band, which thins out when it’s pulled apart and is then compromised at its weakest point). Spreading across two planes, the geometric tri-star form mimics how the body and foot react to force and accounts for the massive changes in foot size (approximately one size in length and two sizes in width) that occur throughout a runner’s stride to deliver support and flexibility.Revolutionary, never before used Soft Foam provides comfort and cushioning without compromising natural motion.Offering breathability with an engineered mesh upper, the new Free RUN incorporates Flywire technology integrated with the laces for an adaptive, supportive fit.Features Include:Engineered mesh upper supports as it moves with you.Low-profile cushioning and rounded heel encourage natural footstrike.Auxetic tri-star outsole pattern expands with your step for flexible cushioning.Flywire technology integrated with the laces for an adaptive supportive fit.Offset: 8mm Last: QD-39

If you want a futuristic runner made out of mesh and breathable synthetic weave upper, it is a good idea to have a closer look at the Nike Roshe One.
It is more a lifestyle and lightweight sneaker that adds lot of comfort without the air cushioning. On the upper you can find tonal stitching in Black, nice and comfortable fabric linning in Black and a foamed sockliner which you can also remove if you want.
On the tongue you can find also a woven Nike Swoosh loop in Black without any stitching on the back. If you need a fresh running silhouette with quarter support, heel support and some cushioning you have to try out the Nike Rosherun. At the sail midsole you will find a special EVA compound, that is soft but supportive and has the durability of a soft rubber.

Nike Free Origins
After learning that Stanford athletes had been training barefoot on the university's golf course, three of Nike's most innovative and creative employees set out to develop a shoe that felt natural and weightless, similar to bare feet. The team spent eight years studying the biomechanics of runners' feet in motion. The results yielded a profound understanding of the foot's natural landing angle, pressure and toe position, allowing Nike designers to build an unconventional and flexible running shoe from the inside out.

If you want a futuristic runner made out of mesh and breathable synthetic weave upper, it is a good idea to have a closer look at the Nike Roshe One.
It is more a lifestyle and lightweight sneaker that adds lot of comfort without the air cushioning. On the upper you can find tonal stitching in Black, nice and comfortable fabric linning in Black and a foamed sockliner which you can also remove if you want.
On the tongue you can find also a woven Nike Swoosh loop in Black without any stitching on the back. If you need a fresh running silhouette with quarter support, heel support and some cushioning you have to try out the Nike Rosherun. At the sail midsole you will find a special EVA compound, that is soft but supportive and has the durability of a soft rubber.

                                    The new Nike Free RUN draws upon new studies that reveal how the foot expands and contracts upon impact with the ground. For this reason, Nike designers have developed an auxetic midsole that allows it to splay upon impact without it thinning out (think about stretching an elastic band, which thins out when it’s pulled apart and is then compromised at its weakest point). Spreading across two planes, the geometric tri-star form mimics how the body and foot react to force and accounts for the massive changes in foot size (approximately one size in length and two sizes in width) that occur throughout a runner’s stride to deliver support and flexibility.Revolutionary, never before used Soft Foam provides comfort and cushioning without compromising natural motion.Offering breathability with an engineered mesh upper, the new Free RUN incorporates Flywire technology integrated with the laces for an adaptive, supportive fit.Features Include:Engineered mesh upper supports as it moves with you.Low-profile cushioning and rounded heel encourage natural footstrike.Auxetic tri-star outsole pattern expands with your step for flexible cushioning.Flywire technology integrated with the laces for an adaptive supportive fit.Offset: 8mm Last: QD-39

NIKE FREE ORIGINS
After learning that Stanford athletes had been training barefoot on the university's golf course, three of Nike's most innovative and creative employees set out to develop a shoe that felt natural and weightless, similar to bare feet. In 2002, they examined a group of men and women with pressure measuring insoles taped to their feet, using high-speed cameras to capture images of each foot in motion. The team spent eight years studying the biomechanics of shoeless running. The results yielded a profound understanding of the foot's natural landing angle, pressure and toe position, allowing Nike designers to build an unconventional running shoe from the inside out.

Spreading across two planes, the geometric tri-star form mimics how the body and foot react to force and accounts for the massive changes in foot size (approximately one size in length and two sizes in width) that occur throughout a runner’s stride to deliver support and flexibility.Revolutionary, never before used Soft Foam provides comfort and cushioning without compromising natural motion.Offering breathability with an engineered mesh upper, the new Free RUN incorporates Flywire technology integrated with the laces for an adaptive, supportive fit.Features Include:Engineered mesh upper supports as it moves with you.Low-profile cushioning and rounded heel encourage natural footstrike.Auxetic tri-star outsole pattern expands with your step for flexible cushioning.Flywire technology integrated with the laces for an adaptive supportive fit.Offset: 8mm Last: QD-39

The larger perforations are strategically placed in areas that need more flexibility while the smaller perforations are in areas that demand more support. The arch has been modified with transtarsal diagonal flex cuts for enhanced twisting, strengthening, and natural motion flexibilityIn the Nike Free continuum, the lower the number in a shoe’s name, the closer it comes to barefoot running (on the continuum, 10.0 represents conventional footwear while zero represents the bare foot). The Nike Free 3.0 shoe is the closest Nike has come to delivering a truly barefoot experience for optimal foot strengthening and flexibility.Ball-to-Heel offset = 4mm differential heel to forefoot drop: The lower the number, the closer to to ground you are and the more it stretches your Achilles tendon. This helps you run more naturally and barefoot-like.The Nike Free 3.0 v4 is ideal if you’re a runner who wants the strengthening benefits of barefoot training, but you don’t want to sacrifice the underfoot protection or multi-surface traction of footwear.

                                    The new Nike Free RUN draws upon new studies that reveal how the foot expands and contracts upon impact with the ground. For this reason, Nike designers have developed an auxetic midsole that allows it to splay upon impact without it thinning out (think about stretching an elastic band, which thins out when it’s pulled apart and is then compromised at its weakest point). Spreading across two planes, the geometric tri-star form mimics how the body and foot react to force and accounts for the massive changes in foot size (approximately one size in length and two sizes in width) that occur throughout a runner’s stride to deliver support and flexibility.Revolutionary, never before used Soft Foam provides comfort and cushioning without compromising natural motion.Offering breathability with an engineered mesh upper, the new Free RUN incorporates Flywire technology integrated with the laces for an adaptive, supportive fit.Features Include:Engineered mesh upper supports as it moves with you.Low-profile cushioning and rounded heel encourage natural footstrike.Auxetic tri-star outsole pattern expands with your step for flexible cushioning.Flywire technology integrated with the laces for an adaptive supportive fit.Offset: 8mm Last: QD-39

                                    The new Nike Free RUN draws upon new studies that reveal how the foot expands and contracts upon impact with the ground. For this reason, Nike designers have developed an auxetic midsole that allows it to splay upon impact without it thinning out (think about stretching an elastic band, which thins out when it’s pulled apart and is then compromised at its weakest point). Spreading across two planes, the geometric tri-star form mimics how the body and foot react to force and accounts for the massive changes in foot size (approximately one size in length and two sizes in width) that occur throughout a runner’s stride to deliver support and flexibility.Revolutionary, never before used Soft Foam provides comfort and cushioning without compromising natural motion.Offering breathability with an engineered mesh upper, the new Free RUN incorporates Flywire technology integrated with the laces for an adaptive, supportive fit.Features Include:Engineered mesh upper supports as it moves with you.Low-profile cushioning and rounded heel encourage natural footstrike.Auxetic tri-star outsole pattern expands with your step for flexible cushioning.Flywire technology integrated with the laces for an adaptive supportive fit.Offset: 8mm Last: QD-39

On the tongue you can find also a woven Nike Swoosh loop in black without any stitching on the back. If you need a fresh running silhouette with quarter support, heel support and some cushioning you have to try out the Nike Roshe One. At the complete black midsole you will find a special EVA compound, that is soft but supportive and has the durability of a soft rubber.

                                    A newly designed tri-star outsole pattern adjusts to your foot's every step, delivering support and flexibility.

The new Nike Free Run Flyknit draws upon new studies that reveal how the foot expands and contracts upon impact with the ground. For this reason, Nike designers have developed an auxetic midsole that allows it to splay upon impact without it thinning out (think about stretching an elastic band, which thins out when it’s pulled apart and is then compromised at its weakest point). 

Spreading across two planes, the geometric tri-star form mimics how the body and foot react to force and accounts for the massive changes in foot size (approximately one size in length and two sizes in width) that occur throughout a runner’s stride to deliver support and flexibility.

Revolutionary, never before used Soft Foam provides comfort and cushioning without compromising natural motion.

Flywire technology is integrated with the laces and Flyknit upper for a dynamic midfoot fit, al

If you want a futuristic runner made out of mesh upper, it is a good idea to have a closer look at the Nike Roshe One.
It is more a lifestyle and lightweight sneaker that adds lot of comfort without the air cushioning. On the upper you can find tonal stitching in black, nice and comfortable mesh lining in black and a foamed sockliner which you can also remove if you want.
On the tongue you can find also a woven Nike Swoosh loop in black without any stitching on the back. If you need a fresh running silhouette with quarter support, heel support and some cushioning you have to try out the Nike Roshe One. At the complete black midsole you will find a special EVA compound, that is soft but supportive and has the durability of a soft rubber.

                                    The new Nike Free RUN draws upon new studies that reveal how the foot expands and contracts upon impact with the ground. For this reason, Nike designers have developed an auxetic midsole that allows it to splay upon impact without it thinning out (think about stretching an elastic band, which thins out when it’s pulled apart and is then compromised at its weakest point). Spreading across two planes, the geometric tri-star form mimics how the body and foot react to force and accounts for the massive changes in foot size (approximately one size in length and two sizes in width) that occur throughout a runner’s stride to deliver support and flexibility.Revolutionary, never before used Soft Foam provides comfort and cushioning without compromising natural motion.Offering breathability with an engineered mesh upper, the new Free RUN incorporates Flywire technology integrated with the laces for an adaptive, supportive fit.Features Include:Engineered mesh upper supports as it moves with you.Low-profile cushioning and rounded heel encourage natural footstrike.Auxetic tri-star outsole pattern expands with your step for flexible cushioning.Flywire technology integrated with the laces for an adaptive supportive fit.Offset: 8mm Last: QD-39

The larger perforations are strategically placed in areas that need more flexibility while the smaller perforations are in areas that demand more support. The arch has been modified with transtarsal diagonal flex cuts for enhanced twisting, strengthening, and natural motion flexibilityIn the Nike Free continuum, the lower the number in a shoe’s name, the closer it comes to barefoot running (on the continuum, 10.0 represents conventional footwear while zero represents the bare foot). The Nike Free 3.0 shoe is the closest Nike has come to delivering a truly barefoot experience for optimal foot strengthening and flexibility.Ball-to-Heel offset = 4mm differential heel to forefoot drop: The lower the number, the closer to to ground you are and the more it stretches your Achilles tendon. This helps you run more naturally and barefoot-like.The Nike Free 3.0 v4 is ideal if you’re a runner who wants the strengthening benefits of barefoot training, but you don’t want to sacrifice the underfoot protection or multi-surface traction of footwear.

If you want a futuristic runner made out of mesh and breathable synthetic weave upper, it is a good idea to have a closer look at the Nike Roshe One.
It is more a lifestyle and lightweight sneaker that adds lot of comfort without the air cushioning. On the upper you can find tonal stitching in Black, nice and comfortable fabric linning in Black and a foamed sockliner which you can also remove if you want.
On the tongue you can find also a woven Nike Swoosh loop in Black without any stitching on the back. If you need a fresh running silhouette with quarter support, heel support and some cushioning you have to try out the Nike Rosherun. At the sail midsole you will find a special EVA compound, that is soft but supportive and has the durability of a soft rubber.

NIKE FREE ORIGINS
After learning that Stanford athletes had been training barefoot on the university's golf course, three of Nike's most innovative and creative employees set out to develop a shoe that felt natural and weightless, similar to bare feet. The team spent eight years studying the biomechanics of runners' feet in motion. The results yielded a profound understanding of the foot's natural landing angle, pressure and toe position, allowing Nike designers to build an unconventional and flexible running shoe from the inside out. ""@en ","""Nike""@en",,7363768," ""Nike Free Run - Concord/Black-Hyper Cobalt-Photo Blue""@en "" Nike Blue Mens Shoes 831508-400 ""@en","""
                                    The new Nike Free RUN draws upon new studies that reveal how the foot expands and contracts upon impact with the ground. For this reason, Nike designers have developed an auxetic midsole that allows it to splay upon impact without it thinning out (think about stretching an elastic band, which thins out when it’s pulled apart and is then compromised at its weakest point). Spreading across two planes, the geometric tri-star form mimics how the body and foot react to force and accounts for the massive changes in foot size (approximately one size in length and two sizes in width) that occur throughout a runner’s stride to deliver support and flexibility.Revolutionary, never before used Soft Foam provides comfort and cushioning without compromising natural motion.Offering breathability with an engineered mesh upper, the new Free RUN incorporates Flywire technology integrated with the laces for an adaptive, supportive fit.Features Include:Engineered mesh upper supports as it moves with you.Low-profile cushioning and rounded heel encourage natural footstrike.Auxetic tri-star outsole pattern expands with your step for flexible cushioning.Flywire technology integrated with the laces for an adaptive supportive fit.Offset: 8mm Last: QD-39

Nike Free Origins
After learning that Stanford athletes had been training barefoot on the university's golf course, three of Nike's most innovative and creative employees set out to develop a shoe that felt natural and weightless, similar to bare feet. The team spent eight years studying the biomechanics of runners' feet in motion. The results yielded a profound understanding of the foot's natural landing angle, pressure and toe position, allowing Nike designers to build an unconventional and flexible running shoe from the inside out.

Genau so stellt sich jeder einen ansehnlichen Sportschuh vor, der nicht nur in seinem Stil einiges zu bieten hat, sondern auch mit seiner Technik glänzt. Der Nike Air Max BW Midnight Navy wird bei dieser Ausführung stolz in Dunkelblau, Weiß und Schwarz zur Schau gestellt. Sneakerfreunde werden sich über diese Farbgebung freuen und können Luftsprünge dank eingebauter Luftpolsterung ohne spätere Folgeschäden durchführen.
Was sich im Obermaterial wiederfinden lässt, stellt sich als Meshstoff heraus und überzieht außer der Zehentasche sowie Teile der Seiten den Oberschuh in Dunkelblau. Eine dunkelblaue Trennlinie aus synthetischem Stoff umrandet den ganzen Schuh einmal. Darüber wurde ein Schweif aus Gummi wiederholt in Dunkelblau gelegt, der einen eindrucksvollen Ausdruck präsentiert. An dem Hacken sieht man Air Max als Namen aus Gummi in Dunkelblau. Noch weiter in Richtung Sohle behauptet sich eine Perforierung wieder in Dunkelblau.
Die Füße können in weichen Meshstoff in Dunkelblau tauchen und fühlen sich, im Inneren angekommen, gleich pudelwohl. Angedeutet wird der Name ""Nike Air"" auf der Zunge erneut in Dunkelblau. Seitlich sind Schnürsenkelösen in Plastik eingearbeitet worden, die Halt für die dunkelblauen Bänder liefern. Kleine Plastikapplikationen in Dunkelblau setzen sich neben diese Halterung und peppen den oberen Teil des Schuhes Ton in Ton auf.
In die Zwischensohle baut Nike die viel gelobte Luftkammern-Technik (Air-Technologie) ein, die beim Auftritt für eine Dämpfung sorgt. Sie ist zusammen mit einem Teil der Sohle in Weiß ein absoluter Hingucker und zieht die Blicke förmlich auf sich. Durch kleine Fenster aus Kunststoff kann in das Technik-Zentrum gesehen werden und man bekommt ein Gefühl für die schon seit vielen Jahren bekannte Einbauweise. Als Laufsohle wurde schwarzes Gummi verwendet, das auch zur Wasserabweisung dient und einen festen Stand gewährt.
Fazit:
Unserer Meinung nach lassen sich diese Sneakers sowohl in der Freizeit als auch für diverse Sportarten tragen. Gerade wer Stabilität als wichtiges Attribut ansieht, hat mit dem Nike Air Max BW die richtige Wahl getroffen. Super bequem und außerdem zu vielen Kleidungsstücken kombinierbar ist der Schuh der perfekte Begleiter im Alltag.

                                    The new Nike Free RUN draws upon new studies that reveal how the foot expands and contracts upon impact with the ground. For this reason, Nike designers have developed an auxetic midsole that allows it to splay upon impact without it thinning out (think about stretching an elastic band, which thins out when it’s pulled apart and is then compromised at its weakest point). Spreading across two planes, the geometric tri-star form mimics how the body and foot react to force and accounts for the massive changes in foot size (approximately one size in length and two sizes in width) that occur throughout a runner’s stride to deliver support and flexibility.Revolutionary, never before used Soft Foam provides comfort and cushioning without compromising natural motion.Offering breathability with an engineered mesh upper, the new Free RUN incorporates Flywire technology integrated with the laces for an adaptive, supportive fit.Features Include:Engineered mesh upper supports as it moves with you.Low-profile cushioning and rounded heel encourage natural footstrike.Auxetic tri-star outsole pattern expands with your step for flexible cushioning.Flywire technology integrated with the laces for an adaptive supportive fit.Offset: 8mm Last: QD-39

                                    The new Nike Free RUN draws upon new studies that reveal how the foot expands and contracts upon impact with the ground. For this reason, Nike designers have developed an auxetic midsole that allows it to splay upon impact without it thinning out (think about stretching an elastic band, which thins out when it’s pulled apart and is then compromised at its weakest point). Spreading across two planes, the geometric tri-star form mimics how the body and foot react to force and accounts for the massive changes in foot size (approximately one size in length and two sizes in width) that occur throughout a runner’s stride to deliver support and flexibility.Revolutionary, never before used Soft Foam provides comfort and cushioning without compromising natural motion.Offering breathability with an engineered mesh upper, the new Free RUN incorporates Flywire technology integrated with the laces for an adaptive, supportive fit.Features Include:Engineered mesh upper supports as it moves with you.Low-profile cushioning and rounded heel encourage natural footstrike.Auxetic tri-star outsole pattern expands with your step for flexible cushioning.Flywire technology integrated with the laces for an adaptive supportive fit.Offset: 8mm Last: QD-39

Worn by Gerard Piqué, Jérôme Boateng and Andrea Pirlo, the 6th iteration Tiempo Legend furthers its reputation for providing unrivalled fit, touch and traction to establish a new era for this modern classic.FIT:To provide a fit worthy of the Tiempo Legend title, the cleats feature a new integrated tongue construction, which will ensure the tongue won’t slide providing a consistent fit. For support and increased lock down, the Tiempo Legend 6 includes an internal microfiber cage in the midfoot to bring the upper closer to the foot, providing a 1-to-1 fit that will help enhance that dominating touch on the ball.Working in tandem with the midfoot cage, the molded heel counter will conform to the natural shape of the foot to prevent any heel slippage, while a microfiber cloth on top of the insole also works to eliminate any foot movement within the boot.TOUCH:For instant control on the ball, the Tiempo Legend 6 features adaptive K-leather on the vamp of the cleats. This leather is vacuum pressed to the interior cage to provide a quilted effect, for superior touch when passing and receiving the ball.With the leather vacuum pressed, this reduces the amount of water uptake to keep the upper remaining soft and light, while ACC (All Conditions Control) technology provides optimal ball control in both wet and dry conditions.TRACTION:A full length engineered TPU plate and insole board work together to provide these Nike soccer cleats with a smooth transition from midfoot to forefoot and multi-directional flexibility.The SG-Pro stud configuration features fixed studs and two sets of screw-in aluminium studs (11/13mm and 13/15mm) for versatile traction, comfort and underfoot control on soft ground.

If you want a futuristic runner made out of mesh upper, it is a good idea to have a closer look at the Nike Roshe One.
It is more a lifestyle and lightweight sneaker that adds lot of comfort without the air cushioning. On the upper you can find tonal stitching in wolf grey, nice and comfortable fabric lining in wolf grey and a foamed sockliner which you can also remove if you want.
On the tongue you can find also a woven Nike Swoosh loop in white without any stitching on the back. If you need a fresh running silhouette with quarter support, heel support and some cushioning you have to try out the Nike Roshe One. At the white midsole you will find a special EVA compound, that is soft but supportive and has the durability of a soft rubber.

As this underground music scene rose to the street surface, the Puma Suede started making moves among break dance crews and hip-hop club-goers.This revolution, like others, disrupted the norm. It followed the logic of the decade. And so did PUMA. Puma felt the culture shift beneath their feet from strict convention into self-expression. They responded by translating sports gear into street wear.The Puma Suede tells the story of sport-inspired style. This time-honoured member of the PUMA Archive continues to evolve with the times while maintaining its smooth silhouette, swagger and grit. The Puma Suede proves that no matter the decade, the city, the continent -style can be revolutionary.Early break dance crews whole-heartedly adopted the Puma Suede for its sweet tread and smooth, classic look. Basketball legend Walt 'Clyde' Frazier inspired PUMA's infamous 'Clyde' silhouette and made some of his best moves in the Puma Suede.'B-Boy' is short for 'break-boy ' as in 'a break dancing boy'. A growing number of 'B-Girls' are currently on the rise. In a past life, the Puma Suede was a sport hero: In 1968, it was worn by track and field champion Tommie Smith at the Summer Games.'Airtracks' are said to be the toughest and most dangerous break dance moves in existence - cue the Puma Suede treads for traction and take-off.Features Include:100% Suede upper for optimum comfortCentrally-positioned lacing with broad laces for a perfect fitNon-slip and abrasion-resistant outer sole made from 100% RubberPUMA formstrip PUMA Suede archive logo and PUMA Cat logo

If you want a futuristic runner made out of mesh and breathable synthetic weave upper, it is a good idea to have a closer look at the Nike Roshe One.
It is more a lifestyle and lightweight sneaker that adds lot of comfort without the air cushioning. On the upper you can find tonal stitching in Black, nice and comfortable fabric linning in Black and a foamed sockliner which you can also remove if you want.
On the tongue you can find also a woven Nike Swoosh loop in Black without any stitching on the back. If you need a fresh running silhouette with quarter support, heel support and some cushioning you have to try out the Nike Rosherun. At the sail midsole you will find a special EVA compound, that is soft but supportive and has the durability of a soft rubber.

On the tongue you can find also a woven Nike Swoosh loop in black without any stitching on the back.

At the black midsole you will find a special EVA compound, that is soft but supportive and has the durability of a soft rubber.

If you want a futuristic runner made out of mesh upper, it is a good idea to have a closer look at the Nike Dualtone Racer.
It is more a lifestyle and lightweight sneaker that adds lot of comfort without the air cushioning. On the upper you can find tonal stitching in midnight navy, nice and comfortable fabric lining in midnight navy and a foamed sockliner which you can also remove if you want.
On the tongue you can find also a Nike Dualtone Racer branding in white without any stitching on the back in midnight navy. If you need a fresh running silhouette with quarter support, heel support and some cushioning you have to try out the Nike Dualtone Racer. At the white midsole you will find a special EVA compound, that is soft but supportive and has the durability of a soft rubber.

                                    The new Nike Free RUN draws upon new studies that reveal how the foot expands and contracts upon impact with the ground. For this reason, Nike designers have developed an auxetic midsole that allows it to splay upon impact without it thinning out (think about stretching an elastic band, which thins out when it’s pulled apart and is then compromised at its weakest point). Spreading across two planes, the geometric tri-star form mimics how the body and foot react to force and accounts for the massive changes in foot size (approximately one size in length and two sizes in width) that occur throughout a runner’s stride to deliver support and flexibility.Revolutionary, never before used Soft Foam provides comfort and cushioning without compromising natural motion.Offering breathability with an engineered mesh upper, the new Free RUN incorporates Flywire technology integrated with the laces for an adaptive, supportive fit.Features Include:Engineered mesh upper supports as it moves with you.Low-profile cushioning and rounded heel encourage natural footstrike.Auxetic tri-star outsole pattern expands with your step for flexible cushioning.Flywire technology integrated with the laces for an adaptive supportive fit.Offset: 8mm Last: QD-39

                                    The new Nike Free RUN draws upon new studies that reveal how the foot expands and contracts upon impact with the ground. For this reason, Nike designers have developed an auxetic midsole that allows it to splay upon impact without it thinning out (think about stretching an elastic band, which thins out when it’s pulled apart and is then compromised at its weakest point). Spreading across two planes, the geometric tri-star form mimics how the body and foot react to force and accounts for the massive changes in foot size (approximately one size in length and two sizes in width) that occur throughout a runner’s stride to deliver support and flexibility.Revolutionary, never before used Soft Foam provides comfort and cushioning without compromising natural motion.Offering breathability with an engineered mesh upper, the new Free RUN incorporates Flywire technology integrated with the laces for an adaptive, supportive fit.Features Include:Engineered mesh upper supports as it moves with you.Low-profile cushioning and rounded heel encourage natural footstrike.Auxetic tri-star outsole pattern expands with your step for flexible cushioning.Flywire technology integrated with the laces for an adaptive supportive fit.Offset: 8mm Last: QD-39
