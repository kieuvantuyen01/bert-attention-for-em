                            Full HD 1080p with Skype video calls
See and be seen in high-definition quality. Logitech partnered with Skype™ to deliver high-definition 1080p resolution with the C920 webcam.*

H.264 AVC compression
Get high-definition (HD) quality video at home or in the office. Real-time HD resolution over typical Internet connection bandwidths requires video compression. C920 webcam uses H.264 encoded compression to provide high quality video at low bit rates

Full HD 1080p recording
Record videos in widescreen Full HD 1080p at 30 frames per second. The same H.264 encoded compression that enables high-definition video calls with Skype, also lets you capture great videos.

HD 720p video call quality
If Skype is not your favorite video-call service, C920 delivers HD 720p calling on most major instant messaging services.

Sharp, rich-color images
Smooth video quality, rich colors and clear sound in real-world environments are produced by Logitech Fluid Crystal™ technology.

Auto focus
C920 uses the same type auto-focus motor used in smartphone cameras. Optimized for webcams, the auto focus gives the sharpest image possible, even as close as 10 cm.

Carl Zeiss optics
To bring you the best webcam images possible, Logitech and Carl Zeiss turned the classic four-element Zeiss Tessar® design into a five-element design. The new design focuses light onto the sensor with maximum detail and minimal distortion.

Stereo audio
A stereo recording or broadcast creates more of a sense of place; it creates a listening environment. Capture video or make a video call knowing that will be heard clearly and naturally.

Stable clip mount
Rubberized bumpers on the clip help hold C920 securely to your monitor or laptop. Also mount it to a tripod

15-megapixel snapshots
Capture brilliant, software-enhanced, 15-megapixel snapshots.

Still photography benefits from a high-speed CPU and an optimized AF algorithm. Full-time manual focus is available in AF mode and the front element does not rotate during focus, perfect for use with polarizing filters. Handheld photography is enhanced by the lens' optical image stabilizer system, offering the equivalent of four stops of compensation. Compact and highly versatile, it is the ideal lens to carry anywhere."" ",,,0

                                    Details
    The HXR-NX100 comes with Sony’s unique 20 mega pixel 1.0-type Exmor R back-illuminated CMOS sensor that delivers high resolution and fantastic low light performance, as well as offering more depth of field control as demanded by today’s diverse shooting requirements. Three independent manual lens rings provide excellent creative control. A fixed Sony G series lens achieves 12x optical zoom, which can be doubled to 24x with Clear Image Zoom making use of the 1.0 type sensor to still deliver a native resolution 1920x1080 image. You can also double the zoom again using a sophisticated Digital Extender for a maximum 48x zoom. There is also a ND Filter function, allowing you to choose four conventional mechanical ND filter positions that will enhance your ability to work in any shooting scenario.
Additional advanced features include dual media slots, “SIMUL” or “RELAY” recording, and independent record control. Recording formats are AVCHD, DV and XAVC S 50Mbps for multiple choices and high quality images. Professional audio quality is made easy thanks to XLR connectors as standard and Multi Interface (MI) Shoe supporting fully integrated wireless audio solutions, such as Sony’s UWP-D range.

                            The Manfrotto MT055CXPRO4 Carbon Fiber Tripod is a 4-section support that replaces the 055CXPRO4 tripod. It has a load capacity of 19.8 lb and extends from 3.5"" to 66.9"". Its carbon fiber legs are secured by the Quick Power Locks. These updated flip locks increase the tripod's rigidity by 50% compared to its predecessor.  A redesigned center column has a ""one finger"" operation, and includes an Easy Link 3/8""-16 attachment for attaching accessories such as an LED light or a reflector via a compatibhttps://www.optics4birding.com/media/images/products/152974-1.jpgle arm. The center column can be positioned horizontally, allowing for low-angle and macro photography. The upper disc where a tripod head is mounted has been redesigned as well, and now has a bull's eye bubble level that rotates 360° so you can locate it where you can see it. This allows you to level your camera on both the horizontal and vertical planes.

From now through September 30, 2016, Manfrotto is offering mail-in rebates on 055 and 190 series tripods and legs. Rebate amounts vary from item to item. See the rebate forms for kits and  for legs only.

Carl Zeiss optics
To bring you the best webcam images possible, Logitech and Carl Zeiss turned the classic four-element Zeiss Tessar® design into a five-element design. The new design focuses light onto the sensor with maximum detail and minimal distortion.

Stereo audio
A stereo recording or broadcast creates more of a sense of place; it creates a listening environment. Capture video or make a video call knowing that will be heard clearly and naturally.

Along with the Deluxe model, the Clamp-On remote control unit promises real innovation in the field of HDSLR filming by circumventing the need for any physical contact between follow-focus equipment and the camera lens, instead wiring directly into the camera body to use the internal focus control systems.<br />
The advantages are obvious: lenses can be swapped easily without extra hardware or adjustment, nothing jolts the camera unexpectedly during follow-focus, one-man camera operation is easier, and control at a distance is as simple as extending the cable between the camera and the remote. The Clamp-On Remote is perfectly integrated into the SYMPLA system, fitting comfortably to the spacer element of a SYMPLA Adjustable Handle and allowing fingertip control of key camera functions without moving the hand from the grips, in turn making support more stable and secure. <br />

                            The Manfrotto MK190XPRO4-BHQ2 Tripod Kit w/ Ball Head is a 4-section aluminum tripod with a 90° center column mechanism, which allows the column to be extended vertically as normal or horizontally. This makes it an extremely versatile tripod, suitable for a wide range of photography applications. The horizontal column mechanism is housed within the tripod's top casting for compactness, but it is easily and quickly extended whenever you need it. Switching between vertical and horizontal column orientation requires no disassembly, and can even be done with a camera attached.  The legs of the tripod are also fast to extend and adjust, thanks to the Quick Power Lock levers that block and unblock each leg section. The special design of the QPL levers allow a stronger and more comfortable single-handed leg lock grip.  The tripod’s top casting has an Easy Link connector to support a photo or video accessory (such as an LED light, flash, reflector, or other piece of equipment) on an extending arm or bracket, and transforming it into a practical mobile studio.

The XPRO Ball Head has a new triple locking system which guarantees camera position stability, friction control helping the user balance the weight of camera equipment and two levelling bubbles to precisely frame composition.  New polymer rings have substituted that unpleasant, messy grease, ensuring smooth, accurate and less jerky camera movement. XPRO Ball Head is portable, lightweight and reliable thanks to its magnesium body and comes with the Manfrotto 200 PL plate.

    The HXR-NX100 comes with Sony’s unique 20 mega pixel 1.0-type Exmor R back-illuminated CMOS sensor that delivers high resolution and fantastic low light performance, as well as offering more depth of field control as demanded by today’s diverse shooting requirements. Three independent manual lens rings provide excellent creative control. A fixed Sony G series lens achieves 12x optical zoom, which can be doubled to 24x with Clear Image Zoom making use of the 1.0 type sensor to still deliver a native resolution 1920x1080 image. You can also double the zoom again using a sophisticated Digital Extender for a maximum 48x zoom. There is also a ND Filter function, allowing you to choose four conventional mechanical ND filter positions that will enhance your ability to work in any shooting scenario.
Additional advanced features include dual media slots, “SIMUL” or “RELAY” recording, and independent record control. Recording formats are AVCHD, DV and XAVC S 50Mbps for multiple choices and high quality images. Professional audio quality is made easy thanks to XLR connectors as standard and Multi Interface (MI) Shoe supporting fully integrated wireless audio solutions, such as Sony’s UWP-D range.

                                    Details
    The HXR-NX100 comes with Sony’s unique 20 mega pixel 1.0-type Exmor R back-illuminated CMOS sensor that delivers high resolution and fantastic low light performance, as well as offering more depth of field control as demanded by today’s diverse shooting requirements. Three independent manual lens rings provide excellent creative control. A fixed Sony G series lens achieves 12x optical zoom, which can be doubled to 24x with Clear Image Zoom making use of the 1.0 type sensor to still deliver a native resolution 1920x1080 image. You can also double the zoom again using a sophisticated Digital Extender for a maximum 48x zoom. There is also a ND Filter function, allowing you to choose four conventional mechanical ND filter positions that will enhance your ability to work in any shooting scenario.
Additional advanced features include dual media slots, “SIMUL” or “RELAY” recording, and independent record control. Recording formats are AVCHD, DV and XAVC S 50Mbps for multiple choices and high quality images. Professional audio quality is made easy thanks to XLR connectors as standard and Multi Interface (MI) Shoe supporting fully integrated wireless audio solutions, such as Sony’s UWP-D range.

About the Cables


Four sets of 100 foot CCTV camera cables are included with this system. If you need to extend your cable run longer than 100 feet, you should consider upgrading to a RG59 cable spool, connector, and tool kit. This allows you to cut the cable to the exact length that you need.



Hybrid HD Surveillance DVR

	


	The DVR included with this security camera system is an SD / HD hybrid. This means that both traditional analog security cameras and AHD high definition security cameras can be used.


	Here is how it works.


	Originally, CCTV cameras supported D1 resolution which is 704 x 480 pixels.
	Then, 960H CCTV cameras were introduced which support 960 x 480 resolution (a wider format CCTV).
	In 2014, AHD cameras (analog high definition), also known as HD CCTV, was introduced which supports 720p resolution (1280 x 720).
	In 2015, full HD 1080p AHD cameras will be available.
	All of these CCTV video formats work using the same RG59 coax cable to run video from the camera to the DVR. However, the video encoding is different between traditional CCTV (D1 and 960H, also known as standard definition - SD) and AHD.
	This iDVR-E works with both traditional CCTV and AHD cameras. Users can also mix CCTV and AHD cameras on the same recorder (hybrid).
	Important! If both camera types will be used, they need to be grouped in pairs of 2 by type.
	For example, you can have 2 SD cameras on channels 1 and 2, and 2 AHD cameras on channels 3 and 4.
	You can also install SD cameras on all channels or HD cameras on all channels, but again, when you mix technologies, it must be done in groups of two.

You can 
learn more about what AHD is here.

11869552," "" Canon EF-S 55-250mm f/4.0-5.6 IS II Telephoto Zoom Lens (discontinued by manufacturer) ""@en-US ""Canon | EISF""@en-US","""Bring your photographic subjects closer with this Canon EF-S 55-250mm f/4-5.6 IS Image Stabilizer Telephoto Zoom Lens. It is designed with Canon's Optical Image Stabilizer technology and is compact and light. This high zoom ratio lens is equivalent to a focal length of 88-400mm in the 35mm format (when used on Canon EOS cameras compatible with EF-S lenses). The image stabilizer effect is equivalent to a shutter speed about 4 stops faster than the same size lens without Image Stabilizer. In other words, if the slowest shutter speed you could formerly hold a 250mm lens steadily was 1/250th of a second, with Canon's 4-stop stabilization correction, you could hand-hold at shutter speeds as slow as 1/15th of a second. It also uses a UD-glass lens element to correct chromatic aberration for excellent image quality throughout the zoom range. Filter Size - 58mm Max.

H.264 AVC compression
Get high-definition (HD) quality video at home or in the office. Real-time HD resolution over typical Internet connection bandwidths requires video compression. C920 webcam uses H.264 encoded compression to provide high quality video at low bit rates

HD 720p video call quality
If Skype is not your favorite video-call service, C920 delivers HD 720p calling on most major instant messaging services.

Sharp, rich-color images
Smooth video quality, rich colors and clear sound in real-world environments are produced by Logitech Fluid Crystal™ technology.

Auto focus
C920 uses the same type auto-focus motor used in smartphone cameras. Optimized for webcams, the auto focus gives the sharpest image possible, even as close as 10 cm.

Carl Zeiss optics
To bring you the best webcam images possible, Logitech and Carl Zeiss turned the classic four-element Zeiss Tessar® design into a five-element design. The new design focuses light onto the sensor with maximum detail and minimal distortion.

Stereo audio
A stereo recording or broadcast creates more of a sense of place; it creates a listening environment. Capture video or make a video call knowing that will be heard clearly and naturally.

Stable clip mount
Rubberized bumpers on the clip help hold C920 securely to your monitor or laptop. Also mount it to a tripod

15-megapixel snapshots

In other words, if the slowest shutter speed you could formerly hold a 250mm lens steadily was 1/250th of a second, with Canon's 4-stop stabilization correction, you could hand-hold at shutter speeds as slow as 1/15th of a second. It also uses a UD-glass lens element to correct chromatic aberration for excellent image quality throughout the zoom range. Filter Size - 58mm Max.

It allows users to load a choice of one, or two LP-E6 battery packs. With two packs, the already-impressive battery life is doubled, compared to using a single LP-E6 pack in-camera. This is especially useful when taking advantage of the camera's movie mode or Live View mode - operating modes that use more power.The BG-E11 also provides full vertical shooting controls, which can be independently turned on or off as the photographer needs to enhance camera handling, especially for shooting vertical pictures. It has a large number of operating controls as well: shutter button, Main Dial, multi-controller, AF point selection button, AE lock/FE lock button, AF start button, and multi-function button.""

                            The Manfrotto MT055CXPRO4 Carbon Fiber Tripod is a 4-section support that replaces the 055CXPRO4 tripod. It has a load capacity of 19.8 lb and extends from 3.5"" to 66.9"". Its carbon fiber legs are secured by the Quick Power Locks. These updated flip locks increase the tripod's rigidity by 50% compared to its predecessor.  A redesigned center column has a ""one finger"" operation, and includes an Easy Link 3/8""-16 attachment for attaching accessories such as an LED light or a reflector via a compatibhttps://www.optics4birding.com/media/images/products/152974-1.jpgle arm. The center column can be positioned horizontally, allowing for low-angle and macro photography. The upper disc where a tripod head is mounted has been redesigned as well, and now has a bull's eye bubble level that rotates 360° so you can locate it where you can see it. This allows you to level your camera on both the horizontal and vertical planes.

From now through September 30, 2016, Manfrotto is offering mail-in rebates on 055 and 190 series tripods and legs. Rebate amounts vary from item to item. See the rebate forms for kits and  for legs only.

<br />
The MVH500AH is a lightweight head with a wider platform for HDSLR bodies and the sliding plate travels to balance the latest interchangeable lens cameras. The entry-level 500 ensures smooth shots and fine control with up to 5kg (11 lbs) of equipment. <br />
<br />
It&rsquo;s the most compact head in our successful Bridging Technology&trade; range and it also replaces the Manfrotto 701HDV video head. <br />
<br />
Beautifully smooth shots: the 500 has professional fluid cartridges on both pan and tilt axes to ensure that every camera movement is smooth, controlled and precise. <br />
<br />
Faster, easier and safer to use: the side lock system allows the camera and sliding QR plate to click quickly into the head from above, instead of needing to be aligned and slid in from the back. No secondary safety lock is necessary. The side lock system also makes it quicker and simpler to lift the camera out of the head from above. <br />
<br />
The 500 has a pre-set counterbalance of 2.4kg (5.3 lbs), but is able to support equipment of up to 5kg (11 lbs). The 500 has one Easy Link 3/8&rdquo; connector to allow an external monitor or other accessory equipment to be fitted.<br />

The 755CX3 Carbon Fibre MDeVe tripod is a hybrid two-stage (or 3-section), carbon fiber single leg-tube tripod that&rsquo;s compact and lightweight. It has a flat head plate, but a built-in MDeVe 50mm half-ball levelling system (locked by a rotating grip at the bottom of the centre column), which allows the camera operator to level the camera without needing to make micro adjustments to each individual tripod leg. Tension-adjustable flip leg levers make setting up and packing away the tripod fast and easy. <br />

This technology also allows for a wider base and a longer sliding plate, so it can support a wider range of digiscoping cameras. The MVH500AH has real fluid cartridges on both pan and tilt axes to help you avoid jarring starts and stops, ensuring smooth video when digiscoping. It weighs 2.1 lbs. and is 3.7"" tall.

This head is designed for executing cinematic moves with compact camcorders and DSLR video cameras. The 502HD comes in two versions -- the ""AH"" flat-base version, which this one is, and the ""A"" ball-base version, which is separately available.<br />

The bridging technology ensures that the pan friction control is intuitive and easy to set, but also protected against knocks.

                            The Manfrotto MK190XPRO4-BHQ2 Tripod Kit w/ Ball Head is a 4-section aluminum tripod with a 90° center column mechanism, which allows the column to be extended vertically as normal or horizontally. This makes it an extremely versatile tripod, suitable for a wide range of photography applications. The horizontal column mechanism is housed within the tripod's top casting for compactness, but it is easily and quickly extended whenever you need it. Switching between vertical and horizontal column orientation requires no disassembly, and can even be done with a camera attached.  The legs of the tripod are also fast to extend and adjust, thanks to the Quick Power Lock levers that block and unblock each leg section. The special design of the QPL levers allow a stronger and more comfortable single-handed leg lock grip.  The tripod’s top casting has an Easy Link connector to support a photo or video accessory (such as an LED light, flash, reflector, or other piece of equipment) on an extending arm or bracket, and transforming it into a practical mobile studio.

The XPRO Ball Head has a new triple locking system which guarantees camera position stability, friction control helping the user balance the weight of camera equipment and two levelling bubbles to precisely frame composition.  New polymer rings have substituted that unpleasant, messy grease, ensuring smooth, accurate and less jerky camera movement. XPRO Ball Head is portable, lightweight and reliable thanks to its magnesium body and comes with the Manfrotto 200 PL plate.

                                    Details
    Now there’s an even more versatile, more capable, more responsive version of Sony’s FS7. Based on feedback from cinematographers, we’ve complemented the FS7 with the FS7 II. Here’s all the performance of the original, and more. Surpass ordinary exposure control with our Electronic Variable ND filter. Secure your lenses with our Lever Lock type E-Mount. Work faster, with greater confidence thanks to even more refined ergonomics. And change your point of view with Sony’s highly capable 18-110mm servo zoom. Welcome to the next level in handheld shooting.
Electronic Variable ND
Here’s a fresh way to control exposure. Aperture adjustments affect your depth of field. Shutter speed adjustments affect the presentation of motion. But Sony’s Electronic Variable ND maintains optimum exposure without sacrificing any other parameters. Auto ND mode achieves auto exposure with cine lenses, rangefinder glass and third-party SLR lenses. And Auto ND empowers you to park your iris at the lens “sweet spot,” where distortions are lowest and resolution is highest.
Lever Lock type E-Mount
A robust E-Mount with a locking collar makes for more confident lens changes. To mount, simply hold the lens steady and turn the collar instead. When the collar clicks, your lens is securely locked into place. This minimizes image shifting as you work. The Lever Lock type E-Mount also supports heavier cine and ENG lenses without additional rigging. As before, the camera accepts Sony’s E-Mount lenses, along with simple third-party adaptors for PL mount cinema lenses, SLR and DSLR glass, and even classic rangefinder lenses.
Ergonomics to work faster, with more confidence
The ergonomics set the FS7 apart. Now they’re even better. Put the viewfinder exactly where you want it with the robust multi-adjustable arm. Extend Sony’s telescoping Smart Grip arm entirely without tools. Park the arm alongside the body for waist-level shooting. Then experience the Smart Grip, body shape and balance that so many cinematographers have praised.
And more
To the 4K Super35 performance of the original PXW-FS7, the FS7 II also adds the following refinements.

ITU-R BT.2020 recording is directly compatible with BT.2020 distribution
Pop-up LCD monitor hood in addition to the detachable eyepiece
Improved eyepiece hook for more secure attachment
Easier access to media cards for convenient removal

                                    Details
    The HXR-NX100 comes with Sony’s unique 20 mega pixel 1.0-type Exmor R back-illuminated CMOS sensor that delivers high resolution and fantastic low light performance, as well as offering more depth of field control as demanded by today’s diverse shooting requirements. Three independent manual lens rings provide excellent creative control. A fixed Sony G series lens achieves 12x optical zoom, which can be doubled to 24x with Clear Image Zoom making use of the 1.0 type sensor to still deliver a native resolution 1920x1080 image. You can also double the zoom again using a sophisticated Digital Extender for a maximum 48x zoom. There is also a ND Filter function, allowing you to choose four conventional mechanical ND filter positions that will enhance your ability to work in any shooting scenario.
Additional advanced features include dual media slots, “SIMUL” or “RELAY” recording, and independent record control. Recording formats are AVCHD, DV and XAVC S 50Mbps for multiple choices and high quality images. Professional audio quality is made easy thanks to XLR connectors as standard and Multi Interface (MI) Shoe supporting fully integrated wireless audio solutions, such as Sony’s UWP-D range.

It also has a dedicated pocket for a 13"" laptop at the back, and a padded zippered pocket for a tablet on the inside of the front flap. For quick access to your gear, the front flap opens all the way down to reveal the main compartment. For further convenience, the Pro Backpack features numerous exterior and interior pockets.  Made from water-repellent Cordura nylon, this Pro bag features a multi-layered construction and a front shield that, along with four shock-absorbing feet, better diverts impact away from the middle of the bag. For further impact protection, the Pro bag features red rigid padded interior dividers that are built to withstand impact within the middle of the bag and maintain the interior shape.  For convenience when traveling, there is a nylon-webbed trolley strap at the back. For carrying the bag, there is a detachable adjustable shoulder harness with an included waist belt and sternum strap, and a grab handle at the top. Additionally, a removable rain cover is included for inclement weather.

                            The Manfrotto MK190XPRO4-BHQ2 Tripod Kit w/ Ball Head is a 4-section aluminum tripod with a 90° center column mechanism, which allows the column to be extended vertically as normal or horizontally. This makes it an extremely versatile tripod, suitable for a wide range of photography applications. The horizontal column mechanism is housed within the tripod's top casting for compactness, but it is easily and quickly extended whenever you need it. Switching between vertical and horizontal column orientation requires no disassembly, and can even be done with a camera attached.  The legs of the tripod are also fast to extend and adjust, thanks to the Quick Power Lock levers that block and unblock each leg section. The special design of the QPL levers allow a stronger and more comfortable single-handed leg lock grip.  The tripod’s top casting has an Easy Link connector to support a photo or video accessory (such as an LED light, flash, reflector, or other piece of equipment) on an extending arm or bracket, and transforming it into a practical mobile studio.

The XPRO Ball Head has a new triple locking system which guarantees camera position stability, friction control helping the user balance the weight of camera equipment and two levelling bubbles to precisely frame composition.  New polymer rings have substituted that unpleasant, messy grease, ensuring smooth, accurate and less jerky camera movement. XPRO Ball Head is portable, lightweight and reliable thanks to its magnesium body and comes with the Manfrotto 200 PL plate.

                                    Details
    The HXR-NX100 comes with Sony’s unique 20 mega pixel 1.0-type Exmor R back-illuminated CMOS sensor that delivers high resolution and fantastic low light performance, as well as offering more depth of field control as demanded by today’s diverse shooting requirements. Three independent manual lens rings provide excellent creative control. A fixed Sony G series lens achieves 12x optical zoom, which can be doubled to 24x with Clear Image Zoom making use of the 1.0 type sensor to still deliver a native resolution 1920x1080 image. You can also double the zoom again using a sophisticated Digital Extender for a maximum 48x zoom. There is also a ND Filter function, allowing you to choose four conventional mechanical ND filter positions that will enhance your ability to work in any shooting scenario.
Additional advanced features include dual media slots, “SIMUL” or “RELAY” recording, and independent record control. Recording formats are AVCHD, DV and XAVC S 50Mbps for multiple choices and high quality images. Professional audio quality is made easy thanks to XLR connectors as standard and Multi Interface (MI) Shoe supporting fully integrated wireless audio solutions, such as Sony’s UWP-D range.

H.264 AVC compression
Get high-definition (HD) quality video at home or in the office. Real-time HD resolution over typical Internet connection bandwidths requires video compression. C920 webcam uses H.264 encoded compression to provide high quality video at low bit rates

HD 720p video call quality
If Skype is not your favorite video-call service, C920 delivers HD 720p calling on most major instant messaging services.

Sharp, rich-color images
Smooth video quality, rich colors and clear sound in real-world environments are produced by Logitech Fluid Crystal™ technology.

Auto focus
C920 uses the same type auto-focus motor used in smartphone cameras. Optimized for webcams, the auto focus gives the sharpest image possible, even as close as 10 cm.

Carl Zeiss optics
To bring you the best webcam images possible, Logitech and Carl Zeiss turned the classic four-element Zeiss Tessar® design into a five-element design. The new design focuses light onto the sensor with maximum detail and minimal distortion.

Stereo audio
A stereo recording or broadcast creates more of a sense of place; it creates a listening environment. Capture video or make a video call knowing that will be heard clearly and naturally.

Stable clip mount
Rubberized bumpers on the clip help hold C920 securely to your monitor or laptop. Also mount it to a tripod

15-megapixel snapshots

                            The Manfrotto MK190XPRO4-BHQ2 Tripod Kit w/ Ball Head is a 4-section aluminum tripod with a 90° center column mechanism, which allows the column to be extended vertically as normal or horizontally. This makes it an extremely versatile tripod, suitable for a wide range of photography applications. The horizontal column mechanism is housed within the tripod's top casting for compactness, but it is easily and quickly extended whenever you need it. Switching between vertical and horizontal column orientation requires no disassembly, and can even be done with a camera attached.  The legs of the tripod are also fast to extend and adjust, thanks to the Quick Power Lock levers that block and unblock each leg section. The special design of the QPL levers allow a stronger and more comfortable single-handed leg lock grip.  The tripod’s top casting has an Easy Link connector to support a photo or video accessory (such as an LED light, flash, reflector, or other piece of equipment) on an extending arm or bracket, and transforming it into a practical mobile studio.

The XPRO Ball Head has a new triple locking system which guarantees camera position stability, friction control helping the user balance the weight of camera equipment and two levelling bubbles to precisely frame composition.  New polymer rings have substituted that unpleasant, messy grease, ensuring smooth, accurate and less jerky camera movement. XPRO Ball Head is portable, lightweight and reliable thanks to its magnesium body and comes with the Manfrotto 200 PL plate.

2240321," ""Sony A7SII Alpha Series Mirrorless Digital Camera Body"" DSLM Body - Texas Media Systems""","""The Sony a7S II Mirrorless Digital Camera offers an impressive blend of sensitivity, dynamic range, resolution, and speed to benefit a versatile multimedia workflow. Starting with a full-frame 12.2MP Exmor CMOS sensor, the a7S II is capable of internal UHD 4K recording at 30 fps with full pixel readout as well as 1080p recording at up to 120 fps, all in the XAVC S format. For both stills and video recording, the BIONZ X image processor also pairs with the sensor to enable expanded sensitivity to ISO 409600, continuous shooting to 5 fps, and fast intelligent autofocus with low-light sensitivity to -4 EV. Further enabling working in difficult lighting conditions, 5-axis SteadyShot INSIDE image stabilization compensates for vertical, horizontal, pitch, yaw, and roll camera movements for sharper, smoother handheld recording.


A7SII Features:
12MP Exmor CMOS sensor
RAW output 14 bit
Internal 4K recording with higher dynamic range
5 axis stabilization
Much improved AF in low light conditions (169 AF points)

With sensitivity settings that can extend up to ISO 409600 (Standard ISO range: 100-102400 for stills and movies. Expandable ISO range: 50-409600 for stills, 100-409600 for movies) plus extra-wide dynamic range, the Î±7S II can record images in spectacular and subtle detail, from shadows to highlights, under virtually any lighting conditions. The remarkable clarity and lack of noise in stills and movies that you shoot help provide the results that you've been aiming for.

Exmorâ¢ CMOS for extra sensor perception: Capture stills and movies of richer, more natural gradation. The 35mm full-frame 12.2-megapixel image sensor achieves wide dynamic range with very low noise throughout a vast ISO 50-409600 sensitivity span. Large pixels, gapless on-chip lens structure, and other light capture advances allow use of extra-high shutter speeds for low-light shooting.

The newly refined image processing algorithm of the BIONZ X optimizes image sensor performance for superior depiction of details in stills and movies throughout all sensitivity ranges. This image processing engine achieves image quality of such fine nuance and minimal noise, particularly at the mid- to high-sensitivity setting.

The processor also provides notable speed throughout the camera system, including the ability to record up to 7 fps in full-resolution, quickened AF speeds, and full HD 1080p video recording. The 3.0-inch Clear View II touchscreen LCD monitor profits greatly from the advent Dual Pixel CMOS AF system and its ability to utilize Touch AF focusing for finely controlled selection of the point of focus.

H.264 AVC compression
Get high-definition (HD) quality video at home or in the office. Real-time HD resolution over typical Internet connection bandwidths requires video compression. C920 webcam uses H.264 encoded compression to provide high quality video at low bit rates

HD 720p video call quality
If Skype is not your favorite video-call service, C920 delivers HD 720p calling on most major instant messaging services.

Sharp, rich-color images
Smooth video quality, rich colors and clear sound in real-world environments are produced by Logitech Fluid Crystal™ technology.

Auto focus
C920 uses the same type auto-focus motor used in smartphone cameras. Optimized for webcams, the auto focus gives the sharpest image possible, even as close as 10 cm.

Carl Zeiss optics
To bring you the best webcam images possible, Logitech and Carl Zeiss turned the classic four-element Zeiss Tessar® design into a five-element design. The new design focuses light onto the sensor with maximum detail and minimal distortion.

Stereo audio
A stereo recording or broadcast creates more of a sense of place; it creates a listening environment. Capture video or make a video call knowing that will be heard clearly and naturally.

Stable clip mount
Rubberized bumpers on the clip help hold C920 securely to your monitor or laptop. Also mount it to a tripod

15-megapixel snapshots

35mm Exmor R CMOS Sensor. The world's first full-frame sensor with back-illuminated structure, the Exmor R combines gapless on-chip lens design and anti-reflective coating on the surface of the sensor's glass seal to dramatically improve light collection efficiency. By switching to copper in the wiring layer, the transmission speed has increased â trumping this camera's predecessor, the a7R. The results? 42.4 Megapixel stills and 4K video with high sensitivity - up to ISO 102,4003.

5-axis SteadyShot. Internal image stabilization on the a7RII compensates for blur and camera shake from five different directions as opposed to two in previous systems. You can view the effects of this stabilization on your LCD when in movie mode.

4K Internal Recording. The Sony a7RII it the first DSLM to offer 4K, full-frame recording to internal media.

The processor also provides notable speed throughout the camera system, including the ability to record up to 7 fps in full-resolution, quickened AF speeds, and full HD 1080p video recording. The 3.0-inch Clear View II touchscreen LCD monitor profits greatly from the advent Dual Pixel CMOS AF system and its ability to utilize Touch AF focusing for finely controlled selection of the point of focus. The monitor's vari-angle design also enables more efficient shooting and viewing from both high and low angles and an anti-reflective, smudge-resistant coating allows for clear well-detailed viewing.

                                    Details
    The HXR-NX100 comes with Sony’s unique 20 mega pixel 1.0-type Exmor R back-illuminated CMOS sensor that delivers high resolution and fantastic low light performance, as well as offering more depth of field control as demanded by today’s diverse shooting requirements. Three independent manual lens rings provide excellent creative control. A fixed Sony G series lens achieves 12x optical zoom, which can be doubled to 24x with Clear Image Zoom making use of the 1.0 type sensor to still deliver a native resolution 1920x1080 image. You can also double the zoom again using a sophisticated Digital Extender for a maximum 48x zoom. There is also a ND Filter function, allowing you to choose four conventional mechanical ND filter positions that will enhance your ability to work in any shooting scenario.
Additional advanced features include dual media slots, “SIMUL” or “RELAY” recording, and independent record control. Recording formats are AVCHD, DV and XAVC S 50Mbps for multiple choices and high quality images. Professional audio quality is made easy thanks to XLR connectors as standard and Multi Interface (MI) Shoe supporting fully integrated wireless audio solutions, such as Sony’s UWP-D range.

                                    Details
    Now there’s an even more versatile, more capable, more responsive version of Sony’s FS7. Based on feedback from cinematographers, we’ve complemented the FS7 with the FS7 II. Here’s all the performance of the original, and more. Surpass ordinary exposure control with our Electronic Variable ND filter. Secure your lenses with our Lever Lock type E-Mount. Work faster, with greater confidence thanks to even more refined ergonomics. And change your point of view with Sony’s highly capable 18-110mm servo zoom. Welcome to the next level in handheld shooting.
Electronic Variable ND
Here’s a fresh way to control exposure. Aperture adjustments affect your depth of field. Shutter speed adjustments affect the presentation of motion. But Sony’s Electronic Variable ND maintains optimum exposure without sacrificing any other parameters. Auto ND mode achieves auto exposure with cine lenses, rangefinder glass and third-party SLR lenses. And Auto ND empowers you to park your iris at the lens “sweet spot,” where distortions are lowest and resolution is highest.
Lever Lock type E-Mount
A robust E-Mount with a locking collar makes for more confident lens changes. To mount, simply hold the lens steady and turn the collar instead. When the collar clicks, your lens is securely locked into place. This minimizes image shifting as you work. The Lever Lock type E-Mount also supports heavier cine and ENG lenses without additional rigging. As before, the camera accepts Sony’s E-Mount lenses, along with simple third-party adaptors for PL mount cinema lenses, SLR and DSLR glass, and even classic rangefinder lenses.
Ergonomics to work faster, with more confidence
The ergonomics set the FS7 apart. Now they’re even better. Put the viewfinder exactly where you want it with the robust multi-adjustable arm. Extend Sony’s telescoping Smart Grip arm entirely without tools. Park the arm alongside the body for waist-level shooting. Then experience the Smart Grip, body shape and balance that so many cinematographers have praised.
And more
To the 4K Super35 performance of the original PXW-FS7, the FS7 II also adds the following refinements.

ITU-R BT.2020 recording is directly compatible with BT.2020 distribution
Pop-up LCD monitor hood in addition to the detachable eyepiece
Improved eyepiece hook for more secure attachment
Easier access to media cards for convenient removal

                            The Manfrotto MK190XPRO4-BHQ2 Tripod Kit w/ Ball Head is a 4-section aluminum tripod with a 90° center column mechanism, which allows the column to be extended vertically as normal or horizontally. This makes it an extremely versatile tripod, suitable for a wide range of photography applications. The horizontal column mechanism is housed within the tripod's top casting for compactness, but it is easily and quickly extended whenever you need it. Switching between vertical and horizontal column orientation requires no disassembly, and can even be done with a camera attached.  The legs of the tripod are also fast to extend and adjust, thanks to the Quick Power Lock levers that block and unblock each leg section. The special design of the QPL levers allow a stronger and more comfortable single-handed leg lock grip.  The tripod’s top casting has an Easy Link connector to support a photo or video accessory (such as an LED light, flash, reflector, or other piece of equipment) on an extending arm or bracket, and transforming it into a practical mobile studio.

The XPRO Ball Head has a new triple locking system which guarantees camera position stability, friction control helping the user balance the weight of camera equipment and two levelling bubbles to precisely frame composition.  New polymer rings have substituted that unpleasant, messy grease, ensuring smooth, accurate and less jerky camera movement. XPRO Ball Head is portable, lightweight and reliable thanks to its magnesium body and comes with the Manfrotto 200 PL plate.

35mm Exmor R CMOS Sensor. The world's first full-frame sensor with back-illuminated structure, the Exmor R combines gapless on-chip lens design and anti-reflective coating on the surface of the sensor's glass seal to dramatically improve light collection efficiency. By switching to copper in the wiring layer, the transmission speed has increased â trumping this camera's predecessor, the a7R. The results? 42.4 Megapixel stills and 4K video with high sensitivity - up to ISO 102,4003.

5-axis SteadyShot. Internal image stabilization on the a7RII compensates for blur and camera shake from five different directions as opposed to two in previous systems. You can view the effects of this stabilization on your LCD when in movie mode.

4K Internal Recording. The Sony a7RII it the first DSLM to offer 4K, full-frame recording to internal media.

It is designed with Canon's Optical Image Stabilizer technology and is compact and light. This high zoom ratio lens is equivalent to a focal length of 88-400mm in the 35mm format (when used on Canon EOS cameras compatible with EF-S lenses). The image stabilizer effect is equivalent to a shutter speed about 4 stops faster than the same size lens without Image Stabilizer. In other words, if the slowest shutter speed you could formerly hold a 250mm lens steadily was 1/250th of a second, with Canon's 4-stop stabilization correction, you could hand-hold at shutter speeds as slow as 1/15th of a second.

4K image quality
Shoot 4K footage that contains about four times more detail than Full HD (3840 x 2160 pixels vs. 1920 x 1080) footage, and capture more of the incredible qualities that bring images to vibrant life.




Extra-light, extra-compact body
The FDR-AX33 is over 30% smaller and over 20% lighter than current model the FDR-AX100, making it the most mobile 4K camcorder on the market.

 




Balanced Optical SteadyShot™
Our advanced image stabilization enables blur-free footage, even when the recording circumstances are shaky or bumpy.




Advanced shooting features
Enjoy total customization with ergonomic manual controls. Use the intuitive multi-purpose manual ring to adjust zoom, focus, exposure, IRIS, shutter speed, AE shift, or white balance shift mode after using the manual button to select the mode. The electronic viewfinder offers accurate image preview.




Super-sampled Full HD playback
Enhance your viewing experience even without a 4K television. Using super-sampling, the FDR-AX33 automatically down-converts 4K footage to exceptionally detailed Full HD.




Trimming Playback
You can select a specific portion of the picture and play it back in Full HD, thanks to 4K high resolution. Also, you can change trimming size2 with the zoom lever or on-screen display icon.

 




Multi Camera Control
More shots mean more editing opportunities. Easily record footage from a variety of angles, whether using cameras mounted directly to the FDR-AX33 or triggered wirelessly. Multi Camera Control makes it easy to sync shooting settings on all devices.

 




Live Streaming via Ustream®
From performances to sports events, some things are best seen in real time. Share scenes as they happen with high-quality picture and sound.

 



 


Highlight Movie Maker
A versatile function to streamline movie editing, Highlight Movie Maker offers several time-saving features. Add highlight points to key moments while recording, and let the camcorder automatically sync your transitions to your chosen soundtrack.




Exmor R™ CMOS sensor
This cutting-edge sensor enhances image clarity, reduces noise in dark environments, and enables soft background defocusing.

 




BIONZ X™ image processor
The advanced BIONZ X image processing engine helps achieve more naturally vivid and lifelike image quality as well as faster processing capabilities.

 




Wide-angle ZEISS Vario-Sonnar T* lens
This 29.8mm wide-angle ZEISS lens providing 10x optical zoom is not only ideal for capturing grand landscapes, among a range of other scenes — it is fine-tuned specifically for 4K.

 




Exceptional image quality
By employing XAVC S format, which was developed from the XAVC format for professional use, 4K Ultra HD and high-bitrate recording of incredible quality are realised. Yet, XAVC S data is compressed so that it is more manageable for general consumers.

 




20.6MP still image capture
Sometimes you don’t need — or want — video. Put your video camera in still image mode and capture amazing high-quality single images as easily as you do with a still camera.

 




Superb night shooting
This feature uses infrared light to take pictures even in complete darkness. By using NIGHTSHOT, parents can easily capture children’s cute sleeping faces.

 




Motion Shot Video3
This convenient feature allows playback of a dramatic sequence of superimposed images to trace every split second of action, a powerful tool for analysing sports motion on screen. During playback, you can adjust the interval between images, or pause to capture still images to share with friends.

 




Dual Video Recording4
Record two movies at the same time — one in the maximum-quality XAVC S or AVCHD format and another in MP4 format. That way you’ve got a small file ready for instant sharing, plus a professional-grade file for further editing.




Face Detection and Smile Shutter5
Use Face Detection to optimise focus, exposure and colour for people who are the most important subject of a shot. You can prioritise a subject’s face by touching it on the LCD. And with Smile Shutter, the FDR-AX33 can also automatically capture still shots of great (but fleeting) smiles, even while recording movies.




Lock-on AF
Enhances the tracking of moving subjects by using the optimal AF point at all times, and adjusting the target frame size to match your subject’s characteristics. Thanks to advances in phase-detection AF, it’s now more accurate than ever — so lock on and shoot fast-moving targets with precision.

 




5.1ch microphone6
Record clear sound that accurately captures the atmosphere of the scene, and enjoy surround sound playback on your home theatre system. Level meters on the LCD panel provide visual monitoring of each channel’s levels.




Auto Wind Noise Reduction
Using an advanced sound-analysis algorithm, this feature eliminates wind noise — the biggest culprit of bad outdoor audio.




My Voice Cancelling
Reduce the intensity of behind-camera sounds, whether you are talking to or cheering on your subject as you shoot.



Golf Shot

                            The Manfrotto MK190XPRO4-BHQ2 Tripod Kit w/ Ball Head is a 4-section aluminum tripod with a 90° center column mechanism, which allows the column to be extended vertically as normal or horizontally. This makes it an extremely versatile tripod, suitable for a wide range of photography applications. The horizontal column mechanism is housed within the tripod's top casting for compactness, but it is easily and quickly extended whenever you need it. Switching between vertical and horizontal column orientation requires no disassembly, and can even be done with a camera attached.  The legs of the tripod are also fast to extend and adjust, thanks to the Quick Power Lock levers that block and unblock each leg section. The special design of the QPL levers allow a stronger and more comfortable single-handed leg lock grip.  The tripod’s top casting has an Easy Link connector to support a photo or video accessory (such as an LED light, flash, reflector, or other piece of equipment) on an extending arm or bracket, and transforming it into a practical mobile studio.

The XPRO Ball Head has a new triple locking system which guarantees camera position stability, friction control helping the user balance the weight of camera equipment and two levelling bubbles to precisely frame composition.  New polymer rings have substituted that unpleasant, messy grease, ensuring smooth, accurate and less jerky camera movement. XPRO Ball Head is portable, lightweight and reliable thanks to its magnesium body and comes with the Manfrotto 200 PL plate.

                            The Manfrotto MK190XPRO4-BHQ2 Tripod Kit w/ Ball Head is a 4-section aluminum tripod with a 90° center column mechanism, which allows the column to be extended vertically as normal or horizontally. This makes it an extremely versatile tripod, suitable for a wide range of photography applications. The horizontal column mechanism is housed within the tripod's top casting for compactness, but it is easily and quickly extended whenever you need it. Switching between vertical and horizontal column orientation requires no disassembly, and can even be done with a camera attached.  The legs of the tripod are also fast to extend and adjust, thanks to the Quick Power Lock levers that block and unblock each leg section. The special design of the QPL levers allow a stronger and more comfortable single-handed leg lock grip.  The tripod’s top casting has an Easy Link connector to support a photo or video accessory (such as an LED light, flash, reflector, or other piece of equipment) on an extending arm or bracket, and transforming it into a practical mobile studio.

The XPRO Ball Head has a new triple locking system which guarantees camera position stability, friction control helping the user balance the weight of camera equipment and two levelling bubbles to precisely frame composition.  New polymer rings have substituted that unpleasant, messy grease, ensuring smooth, accurate and less jerky camera movement. XPRO Ball Head is portable, lightweight and reliable thanks to its magnesium body and comes with the Manfrotto 200 PL plate.

	Resolution meets sensitivity 42.4MP up to ISO 102,400 / 4K up to 25,600
	Durable, reliable and ergonomically enhanced for professional use

35mm Exmor R CMOS Sensor. The world's first full-frame sensor with back-illuminated structure, the Exmor R combines gapless on-chip lens design and anti-reflective coating on the surface of the sensor's glass seal to dramatically improve light collection efficiency. By switching to copper in the wiring layer, the transmission speed has increased â trumping this camera's predecessor, the a7R. The results? 42.4 Megapixel stills and 4K video with high sensitivity - up to ISO 102,4003.

5-axis SteadyShot. Internal image stabilization on the a7RII compensates for blur and camera shake from five different directions as opposed to two in previous systems. You can view the effects of this stabilization on your LCD when in movie mode.

4K Internal Recording. The Sony a7RII it the first DSLM to offer 4K, full-frame recording to internal media.
"" ","""Sony""",,2240321," ""Sony A7SII Alpha Series Mirrorless Digital Camera Body"" DSLM Body - Texas Media Systems""","""The Sony a7S II Mirrorless Digital Camera offers an impressive blend of sensitivity, dynamic range, resolution, and speed to benefit a versatile multimedia workflow. Starting with a full-frame 12.2MP Exmor CMOS sensor, the a7S II is capable of internal UHD 4K recording at 30 fps with full pixel readout as well as 1080p recording at up to 120 fps, all in the XAVC S format. For both stills and video recording, the BIONZ X image processor also pairs with the sensor to enable expanded sensitivity to ISO 409600, continuous shooting to 5 fps, and fast intelligent autofocus with low-light sensitivity to -4 EV. Further enabling working in difficult lighting conditions, 5-axis SteadyShot INSIDE image stabilization compensates for vertical, horizontal, pitch, yaw, and roll camera movements for sharper, smoother handheld recording.


A7SII Features:
12MP Exmor CMOS sensor
RAW output 14 bit
Internal 4K recording with higher dynamic range
5 axis stabilization
Much improved AF in low light conditions (169 AF points)

With sensitivity settings that can extend up to ISO 409600 (Standard ISO range: 100-102400 for stills and movies. Expandable ISO range: 50-409600 for stills, 100-409600 for movies) plus extra-wide dynamic range, the Î±7S II can record images in spectacular and subtle detail, from shadows to highlights, under virtually any lighting conditions. The remarkable clarity and lack of noise in stills and movies that you shoot help provide the results that you've been aiming for.

Exmorâ¢ CMOS for extra sensor perception: Capture stills and movies of richer, more natural gradation. The 35mm full-frame 12.2-megapixel image sensor achieves wide dynamic range with very low noise throughout a vast ISO 50-409600 sensitivity span. Large pixels, gapless on-chip lens structure, and other light capture advances allow use of extra-high shutter speeds for low-light shooting.

The newly refined image processing algorithm of the BIONZ X optimizes image sensor performance for superior depiction of details in stills and movies throughout all sensitivity ranges. This image processing engine achieves image quality of such fine nuance and minimal noise, particularly at the mid- to high-sensitivity setting.

                        The 35mm f/1.8 OSS Alpha E-mount Prime Lens from Sony is a sharp, prime lens for Sony E-mount cameras, including the Alpha NEX-5R, Alpha NEX-6 and the NEX Handycam camcorders. It is a compact, fixed focal length lens which is equivalent to 52.5mm in 35mm equivalency. A fast maximum aperture of f/1.8 means the lens is ideal for blur-free capture of fast moving subjects and for retaining crisp imaging in low light.
A quiet linear motor controls focus while an in-lens stepping motor controls aperture, together they offer smooth and virtually silent lens action, which is ideal for shooting video. Direct Manual Focus is also featured which allows for fine manual focus control and is operable even in autofocus mode. Sony's built-in Optical Image Stabilization system provides approximately 4-stops worth of shake control, making the lens even more functional in low light conditions and great when tracking moving subjects in video.

Its squat stature makes it an unobtrusive lens: easy to wield and easy to store. The STM stepping motor functions quietly and allows for continuous autofocus when shooting video.

The EF 40mm has a wide aperture of 2.8 which, combined with its seven diaphragm blades, creates a beautiful, creamy bokeh. The lensâs configuration includes an aspherical element that guarantees a sharp image covering the full frame.

The advantages are obvious: lenses can be swapped easily without extra hardware or adjustment, nothing jolts the camera unexpectedly during follow-focus, one-man camera operation is easier, and control at a distance is as simple as extending the cable between the camera and the remote. The Clamp-On Remote is perfectly integrated into the SYMPLA system, fitting comfortably to the spacer element of a SYMPLA Adjustable Handle and allowing fingertip control of key camera functions without moving the hand from the grips, in turn making support more stable and secure. Compatible with Canon's EOS 5D Mark ii, EOS 1D Mark iV, EOS 7D, EOS 60D, EOS 600D/Rebel T3i/Kiss x5, EOS 550D/Rebel T2i/Kiss x4 and EOS 500D/Rebel T1i/Kiss x3.

        The Canon TC-80N3 remote lets you control the shutter of your Canon EOS, from a maximum distance of 0.8 meters. Besides ease of use the cable remote also prevents camera shake because you do not have to touch the camera when taking a picture. This is especially important when using slow shutter speeds so you can help to avoid blurry images.
The TC-80N3 can be used to time accurately exposures from 1 second to 99 hours, 59 minutes and 59 seconds.

                            Full HD 1080p with Skype video calls
See and be seen in high-definition quality. Logitech partnered with Skype™ to deliver high-definition 1080p resolution with the C920 webcam.*

H.264 AVC compression
Get high-definition (HD) quality video at home or in the office. Real-time HD resolution over typical Internet connection bandwidths requires video compression. C920 webcam uses H.264 encoded compression to provide high quality video at low bit rates

Full HD 1080p recording
Record videos in widescreen Full HD 1080p at 30 frames per second. The same H.264 encoded compression that enables high-definition video calls with Skype, also lets you capture great videos.

HD 720p video call quality
If Skype is not your favorite video-call service, C920 delivers HD 720p calling on most major instant messaging services.

Sharp, rich-color images
Smooth video quality, rich colors and clear sound in real-world environments are produced by Logitech Fluid Crystal™ technology.

Auto focus
C920 uses the same type auto-focus motor used in smartphone cameras. Optimized for webcams, the auto focus gives the sharpest image possible, even as close as 10 cm.

Carl Zeiss optics
To bring you the best webcam images possible, Logitech and Carl Zeiss turned the classic four-element Zeiss Tessar® design into a five-element design. The new design focuses light onto the sensor with maximum detail and minimal distortion.

Stereo audio
A stereo recording or broadcast creates more of a sense of place; it creates a listening environment. Capture video or make a video call knowing that will be heard clearly and naturally.

Stable clip mount
Rubberized bumpers on the clip help hold C920 securely to your monitor or laptop. Also mount it to a tripod

15-megapixel snapshots
Capture brilliant, software-enhanced, 15-megapixel snapshots.
